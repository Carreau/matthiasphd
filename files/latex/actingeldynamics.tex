\section{Introduction}
\label{parts/part1:introduction}
Cells are the basic component of living organism, understanding their
individual behavior and the way they function is a key step into understanding
how they interact with their environment and other organism. One of the key
component to most of organism is Actin, a protein which is highly conserved
across the species and play a important role in cell mechanics, from cell
migration to cell differentiation and division. It plays also a non negligible
in most mechanical properties of the cell and how it interacts with its
environment. In particular actin is the main component of the actin cortex :
the part of the cell cytoskeleton below the plasma membrane mostly responsible
for cell mechanical properties. The properties of this actin cortex is drive by
the mechanics of the properties of its main component : a dynamic actin
network. Understanding this actin network is hence a key piece to learn how
the actin cortex behave.

The properties of an actin network highly depend on it's structure. The
structure itself depends on many parameters that influence how the network is
formed. Network structure and formation can be not only influence by its
physical and chemical environments but also by the variation of this
parameters with time and space.

Cells are complex systems that adapt their shape, mechanical properties and
biochemical conditions permanently. The spacial repartition of theses
properties is also variable as the cell regulate the concentration of proteins
all across its body. To well study the effect of each components independently,
it is crucial to study actin network in a controlled environment.

Biomimetic systems allow to respond to most of these concern, they provide a
well controlled environment where biochemical condition can be well controlled
both in space and time. Theses systems keep their biological relevance, as they
can mimic \emph{in vivo} phenomenon. Biomimetic systems are also well adapted to the
tools available and the approach from a physics point of view. The optical trap
will allow us to study local mechanical properties of actin  network  with a
high time resolution which could allow to get insight into the variation of
theses properties as a function of time.

During my PhD, my work has mainly be to study the mechanics of branched actin
network polymerizing on optically trapped polystyrene beads. Such network was
studied before {\hyperref[bibitem:kawska2012]{{[}Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012{]}}}  but have suspected to be highly inhomogeneous,
the use of optical trap allowed to probe mechanics of part of the network
unaccessible before.

\section{Living Cells}
\label{parts/part1:living-cells}
\begin{notice}{note}{Todo}
\end{notice}

\begin{notice}{note}{Todo}

We can see in plants that actin, also known as microfilament
{\hyperref[bibitem:iwabuchi2010]{{[}Iwabuchi, Takagi,  2010{]}}} is used to move nucleus away from
\end{notice}

Cells are the smallest living component which are present from unicellular
plants to multicellular animals. Thus, cells should cover a huge range of
behavior going from extremely specific on multicellular organism, to all the
function that are needed to survive and reproduce for bacterial colony.
Multicellular organism will grow specialized cell from neurone to osteoblast
going through germinal or muscle cells. In the other hand, unicellular
organisms are made of cell that are responsible for all the function of the
organism, from motility to reproduction, passing through absorption of
nutriment to replication of the cell.

Cell are hence able to adapt to their environment as a function of time, and
also have function and behavior that depends on time, and a small change of
timing and/or biochemical conditions can highly injure the development of an
organism {\hyperref[bibitem:lenart2005]{{[}Lenart, Bacher, Daigle,  et al.  2005{]}}}, it has also been observe that the mechanical
properties of substrate can govern the differentiation of cell
{\hyperref[bibitem:engler2006]{{[}Engler, Sen, Sweeney, Discher,  2006{]}}} .

Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotype, the cells
all have a common structure. They are constituted by a membrane which is
responsible form separating the cytoplasm from the outside of the cell. The
cytoplasm contains organelles, genetic material, and number of proteins that
the cell use to accomplish its functions. Cells are of course not completely
isolated, and have numbers of mechanism to exchange and communicate with the
outside. Communication with the outside are either chemical or mechanics.  To
sens their mechanical environment, cell use adhesion complexes to attach to the
medium, and integrins as trans-membrane protein will transfer the force to the
cell cytoskeleton situated inside the cell.

This structure, which is situated just below the cell membrane, is named the
actin cortex,


\subsection{The Cell Cytoskeleton}
\label{parts/part1:the-cell-cytoskeleton}
The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which give
it shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that possesses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how a organism move. As feet, fins and
wigs are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal does more
preferably prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton is will tell you many
things a bout a cell.

In the other hand, unlike (exo)-Skeleton of animals which is ridged and
unchanging, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keep
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cell
move. That's through this dynamics that the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As mammals skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cell cytoskeleton is responsible to not only
transmit the force the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses force.
Thats through its cytoskeleton that a cell can be connected to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.

\begin{notice}{note}{Todo}

\end{notice}

The cytoskeleton is mainly composed of three type of filaments.  The
microtubules, intermediate filament and actin filament, also known as
microfilament.


\subsubsection{Microtubules}
\label{parts/part1:microtubules}
Microtubules are the wider with a diameter of 20nm and {[}un article où on voit le diameter{]} the stiffer of the three kinds of filament with a persistence
length in the order of millimeter, which is much longer than the size of the
usual cell. Microtubules are extensively studied {[}cite some reviews ...{]}.
Microtubules form polar (oriented) filament that can be walked on by molecular
motors that can be decomposed in two families – kinesins  and dyneins –
depending on the end toward which the motor preferably walk. Microtubules are
mostly known for their action during the cells mitosis where they will form
majority of the mitotic spindle that drive the segregation of the chromosomes
in two groups, each group ending in one of the daughter cells.

We will not be interested directly into the effect and behavior of microtubules
in this manuscript.


\subsubsection{Intermediate filaments}
\label{parts/part1:intermediate-filaments}
Intermediate filaments are of medium diameter in the order of around 10nm, in
between actin and microtubules filament, hence their name.  Unlike microtubules
and actin filament, intermediate filaments are composed by several sub-families
of proteins and are non-polar.


\subsubsection{Actin}
\label{parts/part1:actin}
Actin, is the third component of the cytoskeleton, the one we will focus most
of our effort. Actin can forms actin filament, the thinest of the three kind
that form the cytoskeleton. Actin is produced in the cell as a globular protein
of \textasciitilde{}40 kDa that once associated with ATP or ADP polymerise into helicoidal
filament with a diameter between 7 and 9nm. The formed actin filament are
polar, which both extremity respectively called the plus (\emph{+}) or
barbed end, and the minus (\emph{-}) or pointed end. The polarity of the actin
filament is of importance as this give rise to a proved direction for most
processes that can happen on the filament.

The actin protein is highly conserved across species, and is know to directly
interact with hundreds of proteins {\hyperref[bibitem:dosremedios2003]{{[}dRemedios, Chhabra, Kekic,  et al.  2003{]}}}. As hint before it
can in particular bind to ATP, that can hydrolyse into, ADP

Single undecorated filament will behave at the scale of the cell as
semi-flexible polymer with a persistence length in the order of 10 µm. When the
assemble into different structure and network, or associate with other proteins
and molecule the resulting mechanical and dynamic properties can be highly changed.

\begin{notice}{note}{Todo}

Should I speak about single filament polymerisation dynamic that is blown
by force application, whereas branched network wil keep a constant velocity
?
\end{notice}


\paragraph{Dynamic of actin polymerisation}
\label{parts/part1:dynamic-of-actin-polymerisation}
The assembly mechanism that allow to go from singles monomers of actin (also
refer to as G-actin in solution) to actin filament (also refer as F-actin)
need to be well understood to explain the different structure of network actin
filament can give once put in presence of other proteins.

The polymerisation of ATP/ADP actin monomer to form an actin filament need to go
through the step of forming a actin proto-filament which is constituted of at
least 3 actin monomers. This will most of the time be the kinetically limiting
step. Once proto-filaments are present in solution, single monomers can be
freely added or removed on both end of the filament.

We now need to distinguish between the dynamic of adding or removing on both
ends of the filament. Indeed it has been show that the association and
dissociation rate are differing between the pointed (-) and barbed (+) end.
More particularly, the association rate at the barbed rate is higher that on
the pointed end, and same goes for the dissociation rate which has a bigger
constant on the minus end of actin filament. This lead to in imbalance of actin
(de)-polymerisation on both ends, which leads to actin filament preferably
growing on the barbed end and preferably shrinking from the pointed end.

The equations that drive the polymerisation can thus be written as follow
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\frac{dC_b}{dt} &= k_{+,b}.[monomers] - k_{-,b} \\
\frac{dC_p}{dt} &= k_{+,p}.[monomers] - k_{-,p} \\\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Where \emph{b} and \emph{p} designate respectively the barbed and pointed end, and
\(k_+\) and \(k_-\) are the polymerisation and depolymerisation rate.
The concentration in barbed and pointed end denoted by \(C_\_\). By
assuming that the number of pointed end is equal to the number of barbed end,
one can derive the steady state which give rise to the critical monomer
concentration below which a actin filament cannot grow: \([monomers]_c\).

The rate constant of elongation of actin have been determined to also depend of
whether the monomer was bound to ADP or ATP {\hyperref[bibitem:pollard1986]{{[}Pollard,  1986{]}}}. We should now
consider the fact that ATP-bound actin will hydrolyse to ADP-Pi then release
the inorganic phosphate, and thus with a rate that also depend on whether the
monomer is part of a filament or in solution.

It should be noted that the in stationary state the length of each actin
filaments statistically constant because the speed of polymerisation on the
barbed end is compensated by the depolymerisation on the pointed end. The
filament is hence in a threadmilling state. If we follow a single actin monomer
bound to an ATP molecule, it will be incorporated at the \emph{+} end of the
filament and progressively move toward the minus end, eventually hydrolysing
it's ATP into ADP before detecting from the filament on the pointed end.

\paragraph{Proteins influencing actin polymerisation}
\label{parts/part1:proteins-influencing-actin-polymerisation}
Despite the already complex process that is actin polymerisation and the
numbers of parameter that we have already introduce, the formation of an actin
network is a even more complex process that involve many other components.
Especially, actin monomers and filament can interact with a high number of
proteins that will effect previously established dynamics.  We will present
some categories of such protein


\subparagraph{Polymerase and polymerase family}
\label{parts/part1:polymerase-and-polymerase-family}
The polymerase family as their name indicate will directly have effect on the
polymerisation of actin. In the right condition, polymerase will increase the
\(k_+\) At one end of the actin filament for the same concentration of
actin monomers. This can lead to an average longer filament length.

\emph{Formins} are one of those polymerase proteins that will increase the
polymerisation rate  of actin filament by dimerising and binding to the barbed
end. It has the particularity of being processive, meaning that it will stay
bound to the barbed and while catalysing the addition of new monomers. We will
see that the processivity of formins also permit the control of the
localisation of actin polymerisation where formin proteins are present, like
the tip of filopodia. \emph{Formin} posses domains rich in proline capable of
binding to profilin (\emph{FH1}) which allow formin to elongate F-Actin using actin
monomers bounds to profilin.


\subparagraph{Actin depolymerisation and severing}
\label{parts/part1:actin-depolymerisation-and-severing}
Like polymerisation that can be enhanced by some proteins, depolymerisation can
also be speed up by divers proteins. ADF/Cofilin is such a family of protein
which is able to speedup the depolymerisation of actin either by increasing the
off rate at the pointed end {\hyperref[bibitem:carlier1997]{{[}Carlier, Laurent, Santolini,  et al.  1997{]}}}, or by actively severing the
filament in different point, thus disassembling the formed network.

It should be noted that depolymerisation can not only be  enhanced at the
pointed end, indeed formin is also able to accelerate the detachment of actin
monomers at the barbed end.


\subparagraph{Capping Protein}
\label{parts/part1:capping-protein}
If cell have possibility to increase of decrease polymerisation speed, they
also need to be able to regulate the by decreasing the polymerisation speed.
To achieve this, some proteins will bind to the growing end of actin filament
and prevent the addition of monomers on the filament. \emph{Capping Protein} (CP)
being one particular example that will specifically bind to the barbed end of a
growing filament and  prevent here from growing. Capping protein are necessary
to prevent circumvent the polymerisation of actin in undesired area and are
essential for the structure and mechanical properties of actin gel
{\hyperref[bibitem:kawska2012]{{[}Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012{]}}}. \emph{Gelsoline} is another example of capping protein, that
unlike CP can only attached to the barbed end of an actin filament after
severing it. Gelsoline is hence both a severing and a capping protein.


\subparagraph{Crosslinkers}
\label{parts/part1:crosslinkers}
We have seen that some proteins were able to attach to actin filament, when
such a protein is able to attach to many filament at once, it can act as an
attachment point between the two filament, preventing them to move with respect
one to the other. Such proteins, are referred to as crosslinkers.

The amount of freedom in movement between the two filament is dependant of the
used crosslinker. For example , \(\alpha\)-actinin will allow rotation of the two
filament at their anchoring point whereas crosslinker like fascine will prefer
a parallel conformation of the filament and favor the formation of actin
bundles.


\subparagraph{Stabilising actin filaments}
\label{parts/part1:stabilising-actin-filaments}
As actin network a dynamics construct that are changing shape and properties
with time, it is convenient to be able to stabilize those network. Tropomyosins
are proteins capable to bind on the side of actin filament to stabilise them.

The use of phalloidin, a toxin extracted from fungus, is also common as by
binding between F-actin subunits on the filament, it prevent it from
de polymerising.  Though, it is known that stabilizing actin filaments with
phalloidin will increase they persistence length which can change the
mechanical properties of the formed actin network.


\subparagraph{Molecular Motor}
\label{parts/part1:molecular-motor}
A particular kind of protein that can bind to cytoskeleton filament are
molecular motors. Molecular motors are proteins that will consume energy source
in the form of ATP, hydrolyse it to change conformation and produce forces.

Different motors exist for each kinds of filament. The  one that walk on
F-actin are part of the myosin family. Myosins head will bond on the side of
F-actin filament and the hydrolysis on ATP into ADP will produce a power stroke
that will make the myosin tail to move in the direction of the pointed. This
will make myosin waling preferably toward the barbed end of actin filament,
pulling anything being attached to its tail with it. The mechanism that allow
myosin to reliably walk toward the right end of the actin filament will depend
on the type of Myosins,  Myosins V for example will be processive and the
single dimers with two head will be able to effect several step in a row.
Whereas \emph{Myosin II} is only able to effect one step before detaching from the
actin filament the processivity being statistically achieve by having  a high
number of myosin filament bundled together.


\subparagraph{Latrunculin}
\label{parts/part1:latrunculin}
Another toxin that act on actin is latrunculin, secreted by sponges,it bind to
actin monomer preventing them to polymerise.  In presence of latrunculin, actin
filament can though only depolymerise.


\subparagraph{Profilin}
\label{parts/part1:profilin}
Profiling is a protein that will bind to the barbed end of single monomers of
actin in solution.  By doing so it will first prevent the association of
monomers into dimers and trimmers, thus preventing the nucleation of actin
filament. It thus allow a better control of localisation of actin filament
both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of actin seeds of actin nucleator.

Profilin as for a long time been believed to be only a sequestering protein
that inhibit polymerisation {\hyperref[bibitem:yarmola2009]{{[}Yarmola, Bubb,  2009{]}}}, though it has a more complex
behavior, and if it prevent polymerisation of actin filaments by the pointed
end, it can facilitate polymerisation. One of the cause of increase in
polymerisation speed by profilin is the fact it binds preferably to ADP-Actin
and increase the exchange rate of ADP into ATP. {[}probably something, look in Yarmola{]}.


\subparagraph{Nucleation promoting factory}
\label{parts/part1:nucleation-promoting-factory}
Nucleation promoting factor, or NPF...

\begin{notice}{note}{Todo}

Write things on NPF, or should  I leave that as subpart like for ARP2/3
\end{notice}


\subparagraph{Branching Agent}
\label{parts/part1:branching-agent}
We have seen previously that crosslinker were proteins capable on linking two
or more actin filament together by binding on their side. Another mechanism
involving binding on the side on actin filament is responsible for a closely
related network, the branching mechanism.

The Arp2/3 complex is composed of seven subunits, two of which are highly
similar with actin, from Arp2 and Arp3 family for Actin Related Proteins,
giving the complex its name. Arp2/3 will bond on the side of a pre-existing
actin filament, from which will grow a daughter filament that for an angle of
70° from the mother filament. The newly created daughter filament pointed end
is terminated by the Arp2/3 complex that will stay attached to the mother
filament, thus increasing the number of available barbed end, without changing
the number of available pointed end. Cf Nature Review by Erin D. Goley and
Matthew D. Welch {\hyperref[bibitem:goley2006]{{[}Goley, Welch,  2006{]}}} for  a longer nger review about the Arp2/3
complex.

The network formed by Arp2/3 is called a branched network, and is in particular
found at the leading edge of the cell, and it is such a network is present in
the bead system we will study hereafter.

When first binding to the actin filament the Arp2/3 complex is initially inactive, it
needs the help of another protein to start the nucleation actin nucleation process.

\subsection{Cell Organelle}
\label{parts/part1:cell-organelle}
Beyond the membrane, cytoplasm and cytoskeleton, cell have a number of
structure that have different and specialised function. The position and
state of each of theses structure is of great importance in order for the
cell to achieve its function. Probably the most known of the organelles is
the cell nucleus of eukaryotes cells that contain the genetic material of the
cell. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic reticulum (also know as ER)
is the organelle that is responsible form translating RNA coming from to
nucleus in to functional proteins that will be delivered across the cell
after maturation through vesicles. Theses vesicles are transported across the
cell by dyneins and kinesins, molecular motors, that walks along microtubules
originating from the centrioles part of the centrosome. All of those process
consume energy as the form of ATP, generated from with the mitocondrion spread
across the cytoplasm.

Like the cell is separated from the external environment by a lipid bilayer
that form the cytoplasmic membrane, each of the organelles are separated from
the cytosol by a membrane with a particular composition, properties and function.

Then positioning of organelle can be of high importance for the life of an
organism.  During meiotic division of cell, for example, it has been seen that
the positioning of the nucleus at the center of the cell in mouse oocyte happen
before its migration closer to the cortex to expel the first polar body.
Failure to do so result in a incorrect amount of DNA in germinal cell that can
lead to infertility.

Same goes with the centrosome which positions at two opposite point in the cell
when it start to divide. Microtubules emanating from theses centriole will be
used to fetch the correct chromosomes and pull them to each of the centrosome
to get the same amount of DNA into each of the daughter cells.

The position of the organelles can have more unexpected effect. In particular,
some nocturnal locust adapt their vision depending on the light condition by
modifying the properties of a part of their eye called the omatidium.  More
specially, the refractive index if each organelle being slightly different, the
reorganisation of the position on mitocondrion and endoplasmic reticulum inside
the cell has been show to be droved by actin polymerisation and responsible
from changed in optical properties in locust eye {\hyperref[bibitem:sturmer1995]{{[}Sturmer, Baumann, Walz,  1995{]}}}.

Movement of organelles is also crucial for plant biology, indeed, genetic
material is sensitive to UV light, and protecting it is necessary for plant
survival. Iwabuchi et al. have show that actin is responsible for the migration
of the cell nucleus away from the part of the cell the more exposed to the
damaging light {\hyperref[bibitem:iwabuchi2010]{{[}Iwabuchi, Takagi,  2010{]}}}.
