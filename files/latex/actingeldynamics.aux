It first passes through two AODs that move the position of the trap in the X and Y direction. The first couple of lenses (L1,L2) between AODs assures that AODs are in conjugated planes. The second pair of lenses (L3,L4) image the AODs plane in the back-focal plane of the first objective. Thus, a change of angle of the light beam induced by the AOD, results in a change of the trap position. The trapping light is collected by a second objective, and illuminates a quadrant photodiode (QPD) conjugated to the back focal plane of the collecting objective. By construction, QPD and AODs should be conjugated, so the deviation of the light beam induced by one of the AODs is not supposed to induce any change of the laser spot position on the QPD. Additional dichroic mirrors allow to use bright field and epifluorescence simultaneously with\IeC {\nobreakspace  }the optical tweezer.}}{33}{figure.1.22}}

The local maxima observed on the 3D representation are well below the global maximum value. The peak at the global maxima is sharp, hinting that the search of the maxima requires relatively good initial parameters (lower than \textasciitilde {}1/10 of the liposome radius). The sharpness of the peak point corresponding to the best fit parameters on experimental data, should be robust}{figure.4.17}{}}
