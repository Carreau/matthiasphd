<p>Cell-sized liposomes are formed by electro formation <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#angelova1986" id="id5">[Angelova, Dimitrov,  1986]</a>.
20 µL mix of EPC lipids and PEG-biotin lipids (present at 0.1 %, mol ) with a
concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in chloroform/methanol 5:3 are deposited on glass
plates coated with  ITO. Glass is then dried with  nitrogen; placed

<p>A chamber is formed using the ITO plates with their conductive sides facing
inside, then filled with sucrose buffer (200mM sucrose, 2mM Tris adjusted at pH
7.4). Chamber is sealed with with hematocrit paste (Vitrex medical, Denmark).</p>
<p>An alternate current voltage of 1V at 10 Hz is applied between the ITO-coated
surfaces for 75minutes to form liposomes.</p>
<p>The same preparation is done a second time by adding 0.9µm sulphorhodamin to
the sucrose buffer in order to mark liposomes inside buffer fluorescently.</p>
<p>The two solution are mixed in order to have the inside buffer of half the

aggregates.  The solution containing doublets is then diluted 30 times. Waiting
15 minutes increase the ratio doublets/single liposome by still avoiding
aggregates of more liposome.</p>
<p>A bulk solution of 40 µM actin monomers — 10% fluo and 0.25% biotinylated — is

<p>5 µL of G-Actin (20% fluorescent) is then added to the previous mix. This
moment parks the time <cite>t=0</cite> for the experiment and recording. The experimental chamber is
build by 2 coverslips that are separated by VaLaP. VaLaP is a mix of vaseline (33%)
Lanoline (33%) and Parafine(33%) in equal mass proportion. The chamber is prepared by gently depositing 20 µL of
the final beads mix at the center of the lower coverslip and 4 drops of VaLaP
are deposited at the position where the corner of the upper (18x18mm) coverslip
will rest. The VaLaP acts as a spacer and prevents the sample to be squashed.  The
upper coverslip is then placed on top of the sample and the chamber is sealed
using VaLaP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qpd-positioning-and-calibration-of-microscope">
<span id="laser-calibration"></span><h3>QPD positioning and calibration of microscope</h3>
<p>The prepared sample is placed on the microscope and a drop of water is

collecting objective. The collecting objective and the quadrant photodiode are
place on top of the sample (<a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#optical-tweezer"><em>Optical tweezer</em></a>).</p>
<p>The trapping laser is then aligned with the photodiode while verifying that no
object is trapped during the process. The conjugation of the back focal plane
of the objective with the AODs and the QPD is optimized by adjusting the
distance of both objectives with respect to the sample.</p>
<p>A trapping laser is positioned near the center of the microscope field of view
using the custom written LabView program (Fig  1). The QPD is adjusted in X and Y direction to
<span class="math">\(\Delta X  = \Delta Y = 0V\)</span>. This is done while no object trapped in

<div class="section" id="initial-bead-trapping">
<h3>Initial bead trapping</h3>
<p>Two maximum strength trap (~50mW/trap) are created near the center of the
microscope field of view, separated by 15 to 20 µm. The sample plane is the then moved in
the Z-direction by displacing the 3D piezo controlled sample stage to position the traps
near the middle plane of the chamber. Temporarily removing the Infra Red filter
from the microscope allows to see the reflection of the trapping lasers on the
upper and lower coverslip and to determine the localisation of the middle plane
of the observation chamber.</p>

The blue rectangle highlights the slider that allows to control the trap power.  The red

</div>
<p>The operator then captures one probe-bead and one actin-bead in each of the
traps.  Both types of beads can be recognized using fluorescent microscopy, as
actin-beads are promptly cover with a fluorescent actin
which  can clearly be distinguished from the probe bead that remains dark.
In the case where two identical beads are trapped one of the two traps can selectively
be disabled or decreased in stiffness, letting the bead escape from  the trap,
and the procedure can be repeated.</p>
<p>The operator will then move the two traps roughly one micrometer in each
direction to check that the two beads are effectively trapped in the tweezer and
that no external forces act on the beads.</p>
<p>For practical reasons, the traps are aligned along one of the principles axis
of the AOD before starting the indentation experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="indentations">
<h3>Indentations</h3>
<p>The operator sets the parameters of the experiment in the software:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Average bead radius,</li>
<li>Approach/Retraction Speed.</li>
<li>Resting Time</li>
<li>Laser Power</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For each pair of actin/probe bead, the initial minimum approach distance of the
traps is set to 5 to 8 µm before a single indentation cycle is done. If the
maximum measured force between the two beads is not higher than 8 to 10 pN, the
minimum approach distance is reduced by 0.25 to 1 µm and the procedure
repeated. Once the maximum force measured is in the 10-15pN range the right
distance is found and up to 10 automatic force-indentation experiments are
performed (Fig  2) . Before each indentation the software automatically does a &#8220;scan&#8221; of
each bead to ensure correct calibration. An indentation cycle has the
following step:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Probe trap is approaching the actin-bead at constant speed until the minimal approach distance has been reached.</li>
<li>At the minimal distance the traps remain stationary for the predefined (typical 3 seconds) resting time.</li>
<li>Probe trap returns to its initial position at constant speed.</li>
<li>Cycle is repeated as many times as set.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>During this cycle the deflection of the laser induced by the probe-bead and
actin-bead are recored by the QPD.</p>
<p>After an indentation cycle is finished the experimenter can try to perform the
indentation on the actin-bead from another direction, or release the actin-bead
proceeding to a new one.</p>
<p>In the case where the indented actin network shows signs of inhomogeneity or
symmetry breaking, the experiments are stopped and not taken into account for
further analysis.</p>
<p>The date and time of each indentation cycle is recorded to extract the time of
polymerisation for each sample.</p>

<div class="section" id="time-shared-optical-traps">
<span id="time-shared-ot"></span><h2>Time Shared Optical Traps</h2>
<p>The optical trap is build on an inverted microscope (Olympus, IX71) equipped with
a fluorescence (200W mercury lamp, Osram, Munich, Germany). The sample is observed
through a Olympus 60X water immersion objective (Olympus) with numerical aperture NA=1.2, that also
serves at entry point for the laser of the optical tweezer.  The light source is
an infrared fiber laser (<span class="math">\(\lambda=1064nm\)</span>, YLP-1-1064, IPG,
Germany). X, Y positioning and stiffness of the trapping force are controlled
by 2 Acousto Optic Deflectors (AODs, AA-Optoelectronics, France) that are placed  in the conjugated plane of
the back focal plane of the objective.
Multiple traps can be achieved by switching the laser between
multiple positions within a switching time in the order of 5 µs, and resting
on each position 20µs or more.</p>
<p>Light refracted by the trapped sample is collected by a 40X (N.A:0.9, Olympus)
water immersion objective and imaged on a quadrant photodiode (QPD) conjugated
with the back focal plane of the light collection objective. Signals from the
QPD (<span class="math">\(\Delta X, \Delta Y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Sigma\)</span>) are sampled at 500kHz, by a Digital
To Analogic Aquisition card (NI PCIe-6363, National Instruments, Austin,
Texas), controlled using a custom written Labview software (National Instruments)
coupled with Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Raw signals are preprocessed by binning all
voltage measured during the time the laser rest (typically 20µs) at one position. Finally
the mean and standard deviation for each trap visit is stored for further processing.</p>
<p>The trap stiffness is inferred from bead radius, laser power, number of present
traps and control experiment data. In control experiments the trap stiffness is
calibrated using the power spectral density method, and was determined
to be as high as 80 pN/µm at full laser power (119mW) for a single trap.
In the case of multiplexing two traps as used in this work, both traps were calibrated before
the experiment.
Coarse positioning of the sample is done through a pair of micrometer precision
screws capable of translating the microscope stage in X and Y.  Finer
positioning in X,Y and Z direction are done with the help of a 3D piezo stage with an
accessible range of 80 µm in each direction and a sub-micrometer accuracy.</p>
