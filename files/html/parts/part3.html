<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have seen that the actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in
cellular mechanics.Essential for force generation, it is a
key component for cell motility. It has also been extensively studied both in
cells and biomimetic systems.</p>
<p>Actin can form a variety of cells networks, ranging from dense branched
networks at the lamellipodia leading edge to bundled parallel structures
forming the filopodia.  The actin network reconstruction has been achieved in
biomimetic systems using purified components <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#plastino2005" id="id1">[Plastino et al. 2005]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#loisel1999" id="id2">[Loisel et al. 1999]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#bernheim-groswasser2002" id="id3">[BernheimGroswasser et al. 2002]</a>,  <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pontani2009" id="id4">[Pontani et al. 2009]</a>, and
many properties of these networks have been measured.</p>
<p>It has been determined that the actin cortex provides mechanical support for the
plasma membrane and that it extends over a few hundreds of nanometers.Many
cellular processes hint that actin structures connected to this cortex, are
key elements in organelle and chromosome positioning.</p>
<p>In this part of the manuscript, we will investigate how a sparse actin structure can
emanate from the actin cortex, and explore its properties. Through the use of the
<a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#bead-motility-assay"><em>bead-motility</em></a> biomimetic system aiming at reconstituting
the actin cortex and its dendritic structure, we will show that a sparse actin filaments network
emanating from the cortex has a mechanical effect, sufficient to
displace objects of cells organelles size at distances up to tens of micrometers
away from the actin cortex.</p>
<p>The actin cortex branched structure underneath the plasma membrane of
cells implies a structure governed by Arp2/3. To what extend can Arp2/3 and CP be used
to form a biomimetic actin cortex has already been widely studied. In
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id5">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a>, both <cite>in vitro</cite> measurements on reconstituted actin cortices
on beads and simulations investigate the effect of cross-linking and
Capping Protein on the formed actin gel. It can be observed both experimentally and in
simulation that a filaments network escapes from what is defined as the actin
cortex (<a href="#fig-bead-tirf">Fig  435</a>). The effect of these long filaments is not taken into account in the
<cite>in-silico</cite> system, where the analysis is restricted to filaments shorter than 10
µm. The effect of dense entangled actin networks generated from
randomly placed primers on the bead surface only participates in the tension increase and
contributes to symmetry breaking.</p>

<p>The limit of the dense network, visible in epifluorescence, is defined in
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id7">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a> by the position of the half-maximum fluorescent intensity (<a href="#fig-intensity-profile">Fig  436</a>).
The networks properties are measured by <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id8">[Pujol et al. 2012]</a> using
magnetic beads and phalloidin-stabilized actin. Though, they do not
investigate the sparse and softer actin networks that originate from the visible
part.</p>
<p>Using <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#time-shared-ot"><em>time-shared optical tweezer</em></a> we are able to probe
the mechanics of this soft actin structure at a timescale shorter than the
characteristic time of actin polymerisation and forces in the pN range. We will show
that beyond the dense dendritic network mimicking the actin cortex, which has
been measured to have an <a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#elastic-modulus"><em>elastic modulus</em></a> in the order of
kPa <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id9">[Pujol et al. 2012]</a>, the soft actin cloud is much softer with
a stiffness in the Pa regime.  This might explain why such a
structure has not previously been observed with less sensitive techniques than optical
tweezers. The size of this actin cloud and its ability to sustain forces
suggest that in cells, the actin cortex is not sharply delimited and that
structures escaping from it may play a role in organelle positioning.</p>
<p>Hereunder are the questions we address in this part of the manuscript :
How far does the soft part of the gel extend ? What are its precise mechanical properties?  How does it change
over time?  Is the actin cloud elastic or viscous?</p>

<h2>Actin-Bead System<a class="headerlink" href="#actin-bead-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reproducing the actin cortex and studying the mechanics of actin structures
emanating from it <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#bead-preparation"><em>required 4.3 µm diameter polystyrene beads</em></a>
coated with a nucleation promoting factor. Theses beads were placed
in the <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#atp-mix-buffer"><em>ATP mix buffer</em></a> in presence of 25nm of Arp2/3
complex, 4µm of monomeric actin (20% fluorescently labeled), 12 µM profilin and
a variable amount of Capping Protein. <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#m-et-m"><em>see Material and Methods</em></a>.
These beads are referred to as actin-beads.</p>
<p>These conditions were chosen in order to grow a dense network on the actin-bead surface as in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id11">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a>. We determined at an amount of 25nM ATP and a varying
amount of Capping Protein concentration in order to cover conditions where the
dense gel formed on the actin-bead was able to accumulate sufficient stress
to lead to symmetry breaking (CP between 15  and 35 nM, see part <a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#bead-motility-assay"><em>Bead Motility Assay</em></a>). We also investigated
conditions where the amount of Capping Protein was too low (&lt; 15nM) or too high
(&gt;35 nM) to permit symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>We selected a 4.3 µm bead diameter in order to get a characteristic symmetry
breaking time of 20 to 40 minutes.
A smaller bead radius implies a
faster increase of stress and a shorter symmetry breaking time.
Chosing 4.3µm provides sufficient time to proceed with the
experiments before symmetry breaking occurs.</p>
<p>All measurements were made on an actively growing actin network which
was not stabilized before symmetry breaking
occurred for Capping Protein concentration in the range 15 to 35 nM <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id12">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="probe-bead-system">
<h2>Probe Bead System<a class="headerlink" href="#probe-bead-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beside actin-bead, the experiment required a polystyrene bead passivated
with BSA. These beads are referred to as probe-beads.  The probe-bead size, similar to the actin-bead’s, ensured the optical
trapping of both beads in the same observation plane. In the case of different beads diameters, the axial forces on the beads were different. This axial
displacement of the two beads during the indentation process led to a
component along the z-axis which  eventually pushed one bead out of the trap.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="experimental-description">
<h2>Experimental description<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to probe the actin network, we trapped an actin-bead with a growing actin-network
and a probe-bead using time-shared <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#time-shared-ot"><em>optical trap</em></a>,  and
measured the forces on the actin-bead, using a QPD placed in the back focal plane of
the condenser (<a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#m-et-m"><em>material and methods</em></a> .</p>
<p>Moreover, all force
recordings used for analysis were made on the static bead, in our case the actin bead, to avoid systematic errors of force measurements on the moving trap.</p>
<p>The indentation is a three step process (<a href="#figindent-time">Fig  437</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>An approach phase at constant velocity 10µm/sec unless specified otherwise</li>
<li>A 3 second relaxation phase during which both traps remain static</li>
<li>A retraction phase  during which the probe trap returns to its initial position at 10µm/sec.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="approach-phase">
<h3>Approach Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#approach-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the approach phase, the probe-trap will approach the actin-trap at constant speed (10 µm/s), as shown in
<a href="#figindent-time">figure  437</a> for times <span class="math">\(t &lt; t_1\)</span>, and the actin-bead
will repel the probe-bead, due to the actin network growing on it. The force undergone
by the actin-bead will progressively increase during the probe-bead approach,
eventually reaching the maximum as the probe-trap reaches its nearest position
to the actin-trap. It should be noted that during this process,
the force between the beads pushes  them out of their respective trap centers.
The beads displacement in the trap remains negligible compared to the
distance between the two beads. Hence, in the following we will consider that the probe-bead speed is equivalent to the trap approach speed of 10µm/sec.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relaxation-phase">
<h3>Relaxation Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#relaxation-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the approach, the trap remains static for a 3 seconds relaxation phase
. The relaxation phase starts at <span class="math">\(t_1\)</span> and
finishes at <span class="math">\(t_3\)</span> as shown on <a href="#figindent-time">figure  437</a>. The duration of the relaxation phase is sufficient to allow the actin cloud  partial
relaxation but remains sufficiently short compared to
the actin polymerisation speed. Hence, the polymerisation is not expected to
change the network properties during indentation cycle and repetitive indentation (<a href="#reproc">Figure  440</a>)</p>
<p>While the actin network relaxes, the forces between the two beads will slowly
decrease, thus leading to the beads getting closer to their trap center and
to each other. There is a slight decrease in distance during the relaxation phase, compared to the distance between beads. The force decrease as well as
the minimal change in distance between the two beads can be seen observed? on <a href="#figindent-time">Fig  437</a>
in the middle part.</p>
<div class="figure" id="figindent-time">

<p class="caption">Figure 437: Upper graph : Force as a function of time on the actin-beads.  Lower graph
: distance between beads (distance between traps + beads
displacement from the trap center) as a function of time. The first part of each graph
(green curve, yellow back) represents the approach phase. The middle part
(orange on white) corresponds to the relaxation phase, and the right part (blue on pale
yellow) is the retraction. The observed data is a subsample of around 1 out of every
1000 acquired points. We can see on the second graph that the beads
displacement on their respective traps is negligible compared to the
trap displacement and justifies the approximation of a probe-bead
speed equivalent to the probe-trap speed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="retraction-part">
<h3>Retraction part<a class="headerlink" href="#retraction-part" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the three seconds of the retraction phase, the probe-trap returns to
its  initial position at 10 µm/s (<span class="math">\(t &gt; t_2\)</span>). During this phase, the force
exerted between the two beads decreases, becomes negative, reaches a minimum, and
eventually returns to zero as the probe-bead recovers its initial
position (shown on <a href="#figindent-time">Figure  437</a> right part). Negative forces
represent the forces that tend attract the two beads towards each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reconstitution-of-force-distance-curve">
<h3>Reconstitution of Force-distance-curve<a class="headerlink" href="#reconstitution-of-force-distance-curve" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The beads position in the trap as well as the force exerted on each bead can be
calculated from the position of the trap over time ( and the signal measured by the QPD. We can then recover the distance between bead centers as a function
of time.  The force-distance curve representing the force exerted by the
probe-bead on the actin-bead as a function of the distance can be computed and is
shown in <a href="#force-distance">figure  438</a> where we can still distinguish the three
phases of the indentation cycle, also marked by the color used for the data.</p>

two bead centers. Colors and data are the same as in <a href="#figindent-time">Fig  437</a>.
The probe-bead starts from the far right, and gets closer
while the force increases (green upper part of the curve), reaches a
maximum, and enters the relaxation phase (orange part), where the force
between both probe-beads and actin-bead decreases, while the distance  also
slightly decreases. During the retraction part (blue), the force rapidly
decreases and  reaches negative values as   the bead returns to its initial
position. The observed data is a subsample of 1 in? every 1000 points of acquired
data. Shaded regions represent areas where the two polystyrene beads should
interpenetrate.</p>

<h3>Repetitive indent<a class="headerlink" href="#repetitive-indent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The indentation cycle can be repeated several times every few seconds, to check for reproducibility and non-plastic deformation of the network after
indentation. As the network is constantly growing during the measurement, this
repeat also allows to check for possible changes of the network properties, due to actin
polymerisation. The force-distance plot is shown in <a href="#reproc">Figure  440</a> <a href="#reproc-time">,  439</a>.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id13">[Gardel et al. 2003]</a> suggests that, for frequencies higher than 0.1 Hz, the force due to
the actin network viscous behavior can be in the same order as the one due to the elastic
component . In order to test whether such a relaxation effect is important, we measured the effect of the
approach speed on the force measurements. <a href="#many-speed">Fig  441</a> presents the
indentation speed affecting the measurement by varying the approach speed from 10
to 30 µm/s on the same actin-bead.</p>

<h2>Experimental observations<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-observations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Through the use of the bead system, we are able to reconstruct actin cortices <cite>in vitro</cite> and
to investigate the mechanical properties inaccessible to other microscopy
techniques like TIRF. Beyond the visible actin cortex, we can detect the
presence of an actin structure with mechanical effects starting at
distances of <span class="math">\(&gt; 10\mu{}m\)</span>, hence far beyond the thickness of the actin cortex (~1µm).
<a href="#cloud-repelling">Figure  442</a> presents a video qualitatively showing that the actin cloud growing
on actin-beads is able to repel free floating probe-beads, before they reach the
visible reconstituted cortex.</p>
<p>In order to quantify the distance at which the probe-beads start to be affected by the actin-cloud,
we measured the experimental noise by studying the fluctuations of the trapped probe-bead.</p>
<p>During the indentation, we defined <span class="math">\(d_0\)</span> as the distance at which the

<h3>Approach phase modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#approach-phase-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We
decided to model each part (approach, relaxation and retraction) independently, to extract their mechanical properties, by using the three phases of the experiment.
In particular, we fitted the force-distance curve of the approach phase using a power
law with 3 fit parameters <span class="math">\(\alpha, \beta, \delta\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa31">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[F(d) = \beta \times \left(d-\delta\right)^\alpha\]</div>
<p>in which <span class="math">\(F\)</span> represents the force exerted on the probe-bead, and <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
is the distance between bead centers. The power law exponent <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is
expected to be negative as the force decreases with the distance <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, and
to characterize how fast the force increases as the two
beads approach each other. The prefactor <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> acts as a scaling factor of the
force. The offset parameter <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> shifts the curve on the distance
axis. This phenomenological model presents the particularity that the force on the probe bead tends to
<span class="math">\(+\infty\)</span> when the distance <span class="math">\(d\)</span> gets  to <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>. The force
is undefined for values of <span class="math">\(d&lt; \delta\)</span>. Hence, the offset distance <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>
practically describes the distance at which the optical trap is no longer able to
indent the network.</p>
<p>In the case of a hard sphere, the value of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> would tend towards
<span class="math">\(-\infty\)</span> leading to a infinite force increase at the contact between the
two hard-spheres of same diameter, and a value of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> equal to the
diameter of the hard sphere.  In this case <span class="math">\(F(d&gt;\delta)=0\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(F(d&lt;\delta)=\infty\)</span></p>
<p>The used optical tweezer being able to apply forces up to 20pN, and the beads
having a diameter of 4.34µm , we hence determined a cross-sectional surface of roughly <span class="math">\(14.7\mu{}m^2\)</span>. Before
escaping the trap, the probe-bead did move up to 1µm from its
trap center. To estimate the maximal stiffness acchievable, we considered that we could
provide a clear measure of deformation in the order of 1/10 of µm,  this
leading to a maximum detectable Young&#8217;s modulus of :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa32a">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[\begin{split}E_{max} &amp;\sim \frac{F_{max}L_{0,max}}{A_0.\Delta L} \\

        &amp; \sim 300 Pa\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Any material with a stiffness much higher than 300 Pa can be considered as
infinitely rigid.</p>
<p>The elasticity of dense actin gels around polystyrene beads has been measured
in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id15">[Pujol et al. 2012]</a> and found to be in the order of kPa.  Therefore, the
optical tweezers are not able to probe the mechanics of the dense gel on the
bead surface. The value of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>  is expected to be <span class="math">\(&gt; 4.34 \mu{}m\)</span> as it partially includes the dense actin gel.</p>
<p>The model can be fitted independently on each experimental
approach phase. An example of such a fit is shown in
<a href="#force-distance-fit">figure  444</a> and the fit quality can be measured by the
coefficient <span class="math">\(R^2\)</span> which has a media value of <cite>0.97</cite>

<p>In our experiments, the polystyrene beads have an average diameter of 4.34 µm,

<span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> values lower than 4.34 µm (21 out of 127) are considered as
unphysical and removed from further analysis.</p>
<p>As expected, we found negative values for <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. Surprisingly, the value
of alpha does not vary significantly when comparing experiments with different
amounts of Capping Protein and remains close to -1, with a mean value of -1.10, and
a standard deviation of 0.38. The distribution of the power law exponent can be
seen on <a href="#power-law-exponent">figure  446</a></p>

<h3>Variation of parameters with Capping Protein<a class="headerlink" href="#variation-of-parameters-with-capping-protein" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the chosen concentration of Arp2/3, the bead system can show symmetry
breaking in the correct range of a Capping Protein concentration of 10 to 30
µM. In absence of Capping Protein, the dense dendritic network does not form on
the surface <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id16">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a>. At low Capping Protein concentrations (<span class="math">\(&lt;10 \mu{}M\)</span>) it seems not able to generate enough stress to
rupture, and at too high concentrations (&gt;35nM, the visible gel is thin and does
not break symmetry either. We then investigated the variation of each fit parameters for Capping Protein concentrating ranging from 0 to 50 nM.</p>
<p>We have already,  seen  that the power law exponent factor <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>
didn&#8217;t vary with the amount of Capping Protein in solution (<a href="#power-law-exponent">Fig  446</a>).
The two other investigated parameters are the prefactor

<h3>Determination of Young&#8217;s Modulus<a class="headerlink" href="#determination-of-young-s-modulus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to determine the gel mechanical properties between the actin and the
probe bead, we modelled it as a purely elastic material. The viscous effects are
neglected in the approach part, as the approach at different speeds shows no
clear effect on the approach curves (<a href="#many-speed">Figure  441</a>). We considered
the compression of the material between the two beads. The surface of the
compressed material is approximated by the bead projected surfaces of the bead along the
direction of compression (<span class="math">\(\pi R^2\)</span>).  The thickness of the compressed
material is regarded as the distance between bead centers corrected by the
distance offset <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, as any material below delta can be considered as
infinitively rigid for the optical tweezer.</p>
<p>The stress exerted onto the material projected onto the bead surface or radius
<span class="math">\(R\)</span> can be written :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa32">
<span class="eqno">(3)</span>\[\sigma = \frac{F}{\pi R^2}\]</div>
<p>For a minor deformation, the local strain of the material <span class="math">\(u\)</span> can be written

probe-bead surface and does not reflect the variation of the uncompressed actin cloud mechanical
properties with position.
Physically <span class="math">\(E_0\)</span> corresponds to the Young&#8217;s modulus as a corrected distance of <span class="math">\(d_c = 1 \mu{}m\)</span>
(See <a href="#ev">Fig  450</a>)
The geometry of the
system and the fluorescence signal suggest a decrease of the actin cloud density according to the distance from the actin-bead center. All values
reported later represent an estimation of the effective Young’s modulus elasticity. The value of this effective Young&#8217;s modulus is 3 orders of magnitude
smaller than the acknowledged elasticity of dendritic gels formed on beads, measured in the
order of kPa <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#marcy2004" id="id17">[Marcy et al. 2004]</a>.</p>
<p>This difference in elasticity might explain why the mechanical actions of this actin cloud have not been
confirmed before in other measurements, like micro-pipette aspiration,
micro needle deformation or Atomic Force Microscopy indentation that have
sensitivities in the order of nN, while the forces exerted by this actin cloud
are in the order of pN.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id18">[Gardel et al. 2003]</a> shows that such low moduli can be obtained using
sparse entangled actin networks, and confirms the idea that the actin-cloud seen

structure than the dense dendritic network on the actin
bead surface.</p>

such actin networks for large deformation <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#semmrich2008" id="id23">[Semmrich et al. 2008]</a> and found that in
our condition, the linear description of these networks holds to describe the
actin cloud.</p>
<p>As <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#morse1998a" id="id24">[Morse  1998a]</a> we expressed the entanglement length as a
function of persistence length and filament density: <span class="math">\(L_e\approx L_p^{1/5} \rho^{-2/5}\)</span>. We can
reduce the expression of the Young&#8217;s modulus to a function of the following
parameters :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The Poisson’s Ratio <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span>,</li>
<li>The persistence length of actin filaments <span class="math">\(L_p\)</span></li>

to extract the Poisson’s ratio (<span class="math">\(\nu\)</span>) of the compressed material :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-nu=f(alpha)">
<span class="eqno">(14)</span>\[\nu =\frac 1 2 \times \left( \frac 5 7.\alpha +1\right)\]</div>
<p>The Poisson’s ratio only depends on the power law exponent and thus slightly varies
with the amount of Capping Protein concentration.  We found a Poisson’s ratio value between 0.1 and 0.2, corresponding to compressible
foam-like materials that do not highly expand in the direction orthogonal to
the compression axis. A previous study of bulk actin network finds a Poisson’s
ration of 0.5 (incompressible material) for an actin concentration of 21.5 µM.  We
suspected that the low actin concentration used in our experiments (4µM) is the
reason for the low Poisson’s Ratio. The local structure of filaments
emanating from the  bead may also explain the large compressibility of our actin
cloud.</p>

<h3>Interpretation<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The results of our data analysis lead to the interpretation that
a dense actin gel with an elasticity close to ~1kPa is polymerised
on the actin bead surface. This stiff gel
cannot be indented by the optical tweezer. Beyond this dense gel, a soft
actin cloud with an effective elastic modulus of 1 Pa and below is
present and extends on distances several times bigger than the thickness
of the reconstituted actin cortex (<a href="#fig-interpretation">Fig  454</a>). The
structure of this actin cloud is expected to be quite different from the
dendritic gel and to be mostly constituted of loosely entangled actin filaments.</p>
<p>In this model, the offset distance <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> corresponds to the limit of the dense
dendritic actin network mimicking the actin cortex that grows on actin beads.
The high elastic modulus of this gel makes it impenetrable for the small forces generated by the optical tweezer we use. The
values of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> we found are coherent with the measured thickness <span class="math">\(e
\simeq \delta - 2.R_{bead}\)</span> of the  biomimetic actin cortex, as measured by
epifluorescence in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id26">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a> and found to be in the range of 1 to 2 µm. The decrease
of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> with Capping Protein is also coherent with the decrease of gel
thickness.</p>
<p>The filaments composing the actin cloud directly emanate from the actin
cortex in which the actin polymerisation nucleation started at the bead surface
. Eventually, a few filaments can escape from the network and are
capped by the Capping Protein provided that the growing extremity is already several
micrometers from the bead surface.</p>

<h2>Relaxation phase<a class="headerlink" href="#id29" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The approach phase of the indentation cycle has been modelled with a purely
elastic mode. However, the force-distance plot shows a significant dissipation
marked by an hysteresis <a href="#force-distance">Fig  438</a>. The repetitive indent cycle, giving the same
force-distance curves (<a href="#reproc">Fig  440</a>), allows to exclude a plastic deformation.
We can hence reject the hypothesis of ruptures of the
actin meshwork or breakage near the entanglement points.</p>
<p>The entangled filaments networks theory that allowed us to understand the link between the phenomenological
model and the mechanical properties of the network, also proposes a relation to
explain the network relaxation.</p>
<p>In this model <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#morse1998a" id="id30">[Morse  1998a]</a>, the visco elastic modulus  <span class="math">\(E\)</span> is a function of time
and can be written as <span class="math">\(E(t) = E\times \chi(t)\)</span> with</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-chi">
<span class="eqno">(15)</span>\[\chi(t)=\sum_{n, odd} \frac{8}{n^2 \pi^2}exp\left(- \frac{n^2\pi^2 t}{ \tau_{rep}} \right)\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(\tau_{rep} = \frac{l_f^2}{D_{rep}}\)</span> is a single fit parameter
depending on diffusion constant for filament reptation <span class="math">\(D_{rep}\)</span> and the
filaments length <span class="math">\(l_f\)</span>. In this form, <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span> is a sum of
exponential decays with well defined characteristic timescales and amplitudes
that decrease as <span class="math">\(1/n^2\)</span>. To fit this model to the
relaxation phase data, we can limit ourselves to the first 40 terms of the sum, as
any of the subsequent terms represent timescales, we cannot reach with our
experimental resolution.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the value of <span class="math">\(\chi(t=0)\)</span> is 1 and should be
treated particularly in order to ensure continuity of the force applied on the
actin-bead in the model.</p>
<p>Using this sum of exponential decays is coherent with the common conclusions of
power-laws found in the frequency-dependant shear modulus of both <cite>in vivo</cite> and <cite>in vitro</cite> actin
networks, as well as the relaxation behaviour found in cells.</p>
<p>In order to determine <span class="math">\(\tau_{rep}\)</span>, the Young&#8217;s modulus established  in the
approach phase is used and the model is fitted against the relaxation data.  A
result of such a fit can be observed on <a href="#fit-3-phases">figure  456</a>. The values of
<span class="math">\(\tau_{rep}\)</span> are highly variable and the fit can be difficult when the relaxation is
slow or in the order of the measured noise. The variation of <span class="math">\(\tau_{rep}\)</span> with the
concentration in Capping Protein can be seen on <a href="#tau-violin">figure  457</a>, and
one example of fit on the <a href="#fit-3-phases">figure  456</a></p>

length ranging from 3 to 8 µm, which is consistent with TIRF experiments and simulation as done in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id32">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a>.</p>

Sticking events can be observed when the force becomes abruptly negative before
relaxing as fast. <a href="#sticking-event">Figure  458</a> shows such a sticking event

<h2>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in many cellular functions.  The
actin cortex, just beneath the cell membrane is not only a crucial structure
for both cell motility and cell mechanical properties, it is also an essential
component in cell division and spindle positioning.  Other actin structures,
that spawn from the nucleus to the cell membrane, are responsible for cell
organelle positioning, as is the case for plants, where the nucleus is found
towards the cell anticlinal wall <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#iwabuchi2010" id="id33">[Iwabuchi et al. 2010]</a>, or during nurse cell
maturation, where the nucleus is pushed away from the dumping
channel:cite:<cite>Huelsmann2013</cite>. The mechanical link from the outside of the cells
to the nucleus using actin bundles has already been shown <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#jaalouk2009" id="id34">[Jaalouk et al. 2009]</a>.
We demonstrated here that these actin structures should not be the only ones
taken into account to explain organelles positioning.</p>
<p>Our experiments confirmed the existence of a sparse and stiff actin cloud emanating
from a biomimetically reconstituted actin cortex.  This actin cloud is capable
of staining forces of tens of pico Newtons, enough to hold organelles in place. By using polymer physics,
we are able to model the behaviour of such an actin cloud and
to measure many of its mechanical properties. It provides an
actin scaffold capable of deforming non-plastically. At time scales of few
seconds it behaves mostly elastically with an elastic module of a few Pascal.
The actin cloud Poisson’s ratio varies from 0.1 to 0.2, hinting at a
sparse structure of loosely entangled filaments, forming a meshwork with a
typical mesh size of 300 to 400 nm.</p>
<p>The filaments at the origin of this loosely entangled network could emanate
from the dense actin cortex that can be seen and simulated on actin-beads
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id35">[Kawska et al. 2012]</a> and the evolution of this actin cloud parameters are is
coherent with the preceding studies on biomimetically reconstituted actin
cortices. Recently, the role of actin networks with the same properties as an
actin cloud have been described in cells such as <cite>Xenopus</cite> Oocyte
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#feric2013" id="id36">[Feric et al. 2013]</a>. The Poisson’s ratios of actin networks have been measured in
bulk to be higher <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id37">[Gardel et al. 2003]</a> but are not inconsistent with our
measurements at lower actin concentration.</p>
<p>The actin cloud provides a novel structure that should be studied further to
understand the positioning of organelles in cells, and to study the role this sparse
actin structure plays in the formation of other actin networks inside cells.</p>
<p>In particular, microrheology experiments could be performed on the growing actin
cloud in order to further characterise the frequency dependence of the actin cloud mechanical
properties. The effect of cross linking and network
branching is crucial for the occurrence of symmetry breaking on bead systems, and
probably plays a role in the actin cloud structure. A confined
geometry and direct polymerisation on membranes, or the effect of myosin motors
might alter the actin cloud properties.</p>
<p>All these, could be cellular mechanisms to use the actin cloud in order
to efficiently form the structures needed for its function.
Further studies of the actin cloud on biomimetic or <cite>in vivo</cite> systems are
challenging, but would lead to a better understanding of the cells mechanics
and its control.</p>
<p>A Paper based on this study has been accepted for publication in Biophysical
Journal and is added for information as appendix of this manuscript.</p>
