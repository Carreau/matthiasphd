<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have seen that the actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in
cellular mechanics. It is necessary for force generation, and a
key component for cell motility. It has also be extensively studied both in
cells and biomimetic systems.</p>
<p>Actin can form a variety of networks in cells, ranging from dense branched
networks at the leading edge of the lamellipodia to bundled parallel structures
forming the filopodia.  Reconstruction of the actin network has been achieved in
biomimetic systems using purified components <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#plastino2005" id="id1">[Plastino, Sykes,  2005]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#loisel1999" id="id2">[Loisel, Boujemaa, Pantaloni, Carlier,  1999]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#bernheim-groswasser2002" id="id3">[BernheimGroswasser, Wiesner, Golsteyn,  et al.  2002]</a>,  <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pontani2009" id="id4">[Pontani, vdGucht, Salbreux,  et al.  2009]</a>, and
many properties of these network have been measured.</p>
<p>It has been determined that the actin cortex provides mechanical support for the
plasma membrane and that it extends over a few hundreds of nanometers. Many
cellular processes hint for actin structures connected to this cortex to be
key elements in organelle and chromosome positioning.</p>
<p>In this part of the manuscript we investigate how a sparse actin structure can
emanate from the actin cortex, and we explore its properties. Using the
<a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#bead-motility-assay"><em>bead-motility</em></a> biomimetic system to reconstitute
the actin cortex and its dendritic structure, we show that a sparse network of
actin filaments emanating from the cortex has a mechanical effect sufficient to
displace objects on the size of cells organelles at distances up to tens of micrometers
away from the actin cortex.</p>
<p>The branched structure of the actin cortex underneath the plasma membrane of
cells hints for a structure governed by Arp2/3. How Arp2/3 and CP can be used
to form a biomimetic actin cortex has been widely studied. In
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id5">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a>, both <cite>in vitro</cite> measurements on reconstituted actin cortices
on beads as well as simulations investigate the effect of cross-linking and
Capping Protein on the formed actin gel. It can be seen both experimentally and in
simulation that a network of filaments escape from what is defined as the actin
cortex (<a class="pageref" href="#fig-bead-tirf">Fig  1</a>). The effect of these long filaments is not taken into account in the
<cite>in-silico</cite> system where the analysis is restricted to filaments shorter than 10
µm. Only the effect of dense entangled actin networks generated from primers
randomly placed  on the bead surface participate in the increase of tension and
contribute to symmetry breaking.</p>

<p>The limit of the dense network visible in epifluorescence is defined in
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id7">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a> by the position of the half-maximum fluorescent intensity (<a class="pageref" href="#fig-intensity-profile">Fig  2</a>).
The properties of these networks are measured by <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id8">[Pujol, dRoure, Fermigier, Heuvingh,  2012]</a> using
magnetic beads and actin stabilized with phalloidin. Though they do not
investigate the sparse and softer actin network that originate from the visible
part.</p>
<p>Using <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#time-shared-ot"><em>time-shared optical tweezer</em></a> we are able to probe
the mechanics of this soft actin structure at time scale shorter than the
characteristic time of actin polymerisation and forces in the pN range. We show
that beyond the dense dendritic network mimicking the actin cortex which as
been measured to have an <a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#elastic-modulus"><em>elastic modulus</em></a> in the order of
kPa <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id9">[Pujol, dRoure, Fermigier, Heuvingh,  2012]</a> the soft actin cloud is much softer with
a stiffness in the Pa regime.  This might explain why such a
structure has not previously been seen by less sensitive techniques than optical
tweezers. The size of this actin cloud and its ability to sustain forces
suggest that in cells the actin cortex is not sharply delimited and that
structures escaping from it may have a role in organelle positioning.</p>
<p>The questions we address in this part of the manuscript are :  How does the far
extends the soft part of the gel? What are its precise mechanical properties?  How does it change
over time?  Is the actin cloud elastic or viscous?</p>

<h2>Actin-Bead System<a class="headerlink" href="#actin-bead-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To reproduce the actin cortex and study the mechanics of actin structures
emanating from it <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#bead-preparation"><em>we prepare polystyrene beads</em></a> of 4.3
µm diameter coated with a nucleation promoting factor. Theses beads are placed
in the <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#atp-mix-buffer"><em>ATP mix buffer</em></a> in presence of 25nm of Arp2/3
complex, 4µm of monomeric actin (20% fluorescently labeled) 12 µM profilin and
a variable amount of Capping Protein. <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#m-et-m"><em>see Material and Methods</em></a>.
These beads are referred to as actin-beads.</p>
<p>These condition are chosen in order to grow a dense network on the surface of
actin-bead as in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id11">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a>. We place ourself at 25nM ATP and a varying
amount of Capping Protein concentration in order to cover condition where the
dense gel that forms on the actin-bead is able to accumulate sufficient stress
to lead to symmetry breaking (CP between 15  and 35 nM, see part <a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#bead-motility-assay"><em>Bead Motility Assay</em></a>). We also investigate
conditions where the amount of Capping Protein is too low (&lt; 15nM) or too high
(&gt;35 nM) to permit symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>We select a bead diameter of 4.3 µm in order to get a characteristic symmetry
breaking time of 20 to 40 minutes.
A smaller bead radius imply a
faster increase of stress and a shorter symmetry breaking time.
The choice of 4.3µm provides sufficient time to proceed with the
experiments before symmetry breaking occurs.</p>
<p>All measurements were made on an actively growing actin network which
was not stabilized and before symmetry breaking
occur for Capping Protein concentration in the range 15 to 35 nM <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id12">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="probe-bead-system">
<h2>Probe Bead System<a class="headerlink" href="#probe-bead-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beside the actin-bead, the experiment requires a polystyrene bead passivated
with BSA. These beads are referred to as probe-beads.  The size of the
probe-bead was chosen to be the same as the actin-bead, which ensure optical
trapping of both beads in the same observation plane. In the case of beads with
different diameters, the axial forces on the beads are different. This axial
displacement of the two beads during the indentation process leads to a
component along the z-axis which  eventually pushes one bead out of the trap.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="experimental-description">
<h2>Experimental description<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To probe the actin network we trap an actin-bead with a growing actin-network
and a probe-bead using time-shared <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#time-shared-ot"><em>optical trap</em></a>,  and
measure the forces on the actin-bead using a QPD placed in the back focal plane of
the condenser (<a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#m-et-m"><em>material and methods</em></a>).</p>
<p>To avoid systematic errors of force measurements on the moving trap, all force
recordings used for analysis are made on the static bead, which is in our case the actin bead.</p>
<p>The indentation is a three step process (<a class="pageref" href="#figindent-time">Fig  3</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Approach phase at constant velocity 10µm/sec unless specified otherwise</li>
<li>Relaxation phase of 3 second during which both traps remain static</li>
<li>Retraction phase in which the probe trap move towards its initial position at 10µm/sec.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="approach-phase">
<h3>Approach Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#approach-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the approach phase, the probe-trap approaches the actin-trap at constant speed (10 µm/s), as shown in
<a class="pageref" href="#figindent-time">figure  3</a> for times <span class="math">\(t &lt; t_1\)</span>. During this approach the actin bead
will repel the probe bead due to the actin network growing on it. The force felt
by the actin bead will progressively increase during the probe bead approach,
eventually reaching the maximum as the probe-trap reaches its closest position
to the actin trap. Note that during this process
the force between the beads pushes  the beads out of the respective trap center.
The displacement of the beads in the trap remains small compared to the
distance between the two beads. Hence in the following we consider that the probe-bead speed is equivalent to the trap approach speed of 10µm/sec.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relaxation-phase">
<h3>Relaxation Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#relaxation-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the approach , the trap remain static for a 3 seconds relaxation phase
. The relaxation phase start at <span class="math">\(t_1\)</span> and
finish at <span class="math">\(t_3\)</span> as shown on <a class="pageref" href="#figindent-time">figure  3</a>. The duration of the relaxation phase is sufficient to allow the partial
relaxation of the actin cloud  but remain sufficiently short compared to
the actin polymerisation speed hence the polymerisation is not expected to
change the properties of the network during indentation cycle as well as
during repetitive indentation (<a class="pageref" href="#reproc">Figure  6</a>)</p>
<p>While the actin network relaxes, the forces between the two beads will slowly
decrease thus leading to the beads getting closer to their trap center and
closer to each other. The decrease in distance during the relaxation phase is
small compared to the distance between beads. The decrease of force as well as
the minimal change in distance between the two bead can be seen on <a class="pageref" href="#figindent-time">Fig  3</a>
in the middle part.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3: Upper graph : Force as a function of time on the actin-beads.  Lower graph
: distance between beads (distance between traps + displacement of beads
from the trap center) as a function of time. First part of each graph
(green curve, yellow back) represents the approach phase. Middle part
(orange on white) corresponds to the relaxation phase, and right part (blue on pale
yellow) is the retraction.  Shown data is a subsample of around 1 of every
1000 points acquired. We can see on the second graph that the bead
displacement on their respective trap is small compared to the
displacement of the trap and justify the approximation of a probe bead
speed equal to the probe trap speed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="retraction-part">
<h3>Retraction part<a class="headerlink" href="#retraction-part" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the three seconds of the retraction phase, the probe trap returns to it&#8217;s
initial position at 10 µm/s (<span class="math">\(t &gt; t_2\)</span>). During this phase, the force
exerted between the two beads decreases, becomes negative, reaches a minimum, and
eventually returns to zero as the probe bead recover its initial
position (shown on <a class="pageref" href="#figindent-time">Figure  3</a> right part). Negative forces
represent forces that tends to push the two beads towards each other.</p>

<h3>Reconstitution of Force-distance-curve<a class="headerlink" href="#reconstitution-of-force-distance-curve" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>From the position of he trap with time and the signal measured by the QPD the
position of bead in the trap as well as the force exerted on each bead can be
calculated. We can then recover the distance between bead centers as a function
of time.  The force-distance curve representing the force exerted by the
probe bead on the actin bead as a function of the distance can be computed and is
show in <a class="pageref" href="#force-distance">figure  4</a> where we can still distinguish the three
phase of the indentation cycle, also marked by the color of the data.</p>

two bead centers. Color and data are the same as in <a class="pageref" href="#figindent-time">Fig  3</a>.
The probe bead starts from the far right, and gets closer
while the force increases (green upper part of the curve), reaches a
maximum, and enters the relaxation phase (orange part) where the force
between the probe and actin bead decrease, while the distance  also
slightly decreases. During the retraction part (blue) the force rapidly
decreases and  reaches negative values while the bead returns to its initial
position. Shown data is a subsample of 1 every 1000 points of acquired
data. Shaded region represent areas where the two polystyrene beads would

<h3>Repetitive indent<a class="headerlink" href="#repetitive-indent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To check for reproducibility and non-plastic deformation of the network after
indentation, the indentation cycle can be repeated several times at a few seconds
interval. As the network is constantly growing during the measurement, this
repeat also allows to check for possible change of network properties due to actin
polymerisation. The force distance plot is shown in <a class="pageref" href="#reproc">Figure  6</a> <a class="pageref" href="#reproc-time">,  5</a>.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id13">[Gardel, Valentine, Crocker,  et al.  2003]</a> suggest that for frequencies higher than 0.1 Hz, force due to
the viscous behavior  of actin network can be in the same order as the elastic
component. To test if such an relaxation effect is important we measured the effect of the
approach speed on the force measurements. <a class="pageref" href="#many-speed">Fig  7</a> presents the

<p>Using the bead system, we are able to reconstruct actin cortices <cite>in vitro</cite> and
to investigate the mechanical properties inaccessible to other microscopy
techniques like TIRF. Beyond the visible actin cortex we can detect the
presence of an actin structure that has mechanical effects starting at
distances of <span class="math">\(&gt; 10\mu{}m\)</span>, hence far beyond the thickness of the actin cortex (~1µm).

<h3>Approach phase modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#approach-phase-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To extract mechanical properties using the three phases of the experiment we
decided to model each part (approach, relaxation and retraction) independently.
In particular, we fit force-distance curve of the approach phase using a power
law with 3 fit parameters <span class="math">\(\alpha, \beta, \delta\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa31">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[F(d) = \beta \times \left(d-\delta\right)^\alpha\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(F\)</span> represent the force exerted on the probe bead, and <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
is the distance between bead centers. The powerlaw exponent <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is
expected to be negative as the force decreases with the distance <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, and
characterizes how fast the force increase as the two
beads approaches each other. The prefactor <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> acts as a scaling factor of the
force. The offset parameter <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> shifts the curve on the distance
axis. This phenomenological model has the particularity that the force on the probe bead tends to
<span class="math">\(+\infty\)</span> when the distance <span class="math">\(d\)</span> get  to <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>. The force
is undefined for values of <span class="math">\(d&lt; \delta\)</span>. Hence, the offset distance <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>
practically describe the distance at which the optical trap is not able to
indent the network anymore.</p>
<p>In the case of a hard sphere the value of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> would tend towards
<span class="math">\(-\infty\)</span> leading to a infinite force increase at the contact between the
two hard-spheres of same diameter and a value of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> equal to the
diameter of the hard sphere.  In this case <span class="math">\(F(d&gt;\delta)=0\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(F(d&lt;\delta)=\infty\)</span></p>
<p>The optical tweezer we use can apply forces up to 20pN, and the beads we use
have a diameter of 4.34µm , hence we determine a cross-sectional surface of surface of roughly <span class="math">\(14.7\mu{}m^2\)</span>. Before
escaping the trap, the probe bead can move up to 1µm from its
trap center. To estimate the maximal stiffness that can be measured, we approximate that we can
provide a clear measure of deformation in the order of 1/10 of µm,  this
leads to a maximum detectable Young&#8217;s modulus of :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa32a">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[\begin{split}E_{max} &amp;\sim \frac{F_{max}L_{0,max}}{A_0.\Delta L} \\

        &amp; \sim 300 Pa\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Any material with a stiffness much higher than 300 Pa can be considered as
infinitely rigid.</p>
<p>The elasticity of dense actin gels around polystyrene beads has been measured
in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id15">[Pujol, dRoure, Fermigier, Heuvingh,  2012]</a> and found to be in the order of kPa.  Therefore the
optical tweezers are not able to probe the mechanics of the dense gel on the
surface of the bead. The value of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>  is expected to be <span class="math">\(&gt; 4.34 \mu{}m\)</span> as it include partially the dense actin gel.</p>
<p>The model can be fitted independently on each experimental
approach phase. An example of such a fit is shown in
<a class="pageref" href="#force-distance-fit">figure  10</a> and the quality of fit can be measure by the
coefficient <span class="math">\(R^2\)</span> which has a media value of <cite>0.97</cite>

<p>In our experiments, the polystyrene beads have an average diameter of 4.34 µm,
thus we expect <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> to be higher than the bead diameter since the beads cannot interpenetrates.  Data with

<p>As expected we find negative values for <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. Surprisingly the value
of alpha does not vary significantly when comparing experiments with different
amount of Capping Protein and stay close to -1, with a mean value of -1.10, and
a standard deviation of 0.38. The distribution of the power law exponent can be
seen on <a class="pageref" href="#power-law-exponent">figure  12</a></p>

<h3>Variation of parameters with Capping Protein<a class="headerlink" href="#variation-of-parameters-with-capping-protein" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the chosen concentration of Arp2/3 the bead system can show symmetry
breaking in the correct range of concentration of Capping Protein of 10 to 30
µM. In absence of Capping Protein the dense dendritic network does not form on
the surface <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id16">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a>. At low Capping Protein concentrations (<span class="math">\(&lt;10 \mu{}M\)</span>) it seem not to be able to generate enough stress to
rupture, and at too high concentration (&gt;35nM) the visible gel is thin and do
not break symmetry either. We then investigated the variation of each of the
fit parameters for concentrating of Capping Protein ranging from 0 to 50 nM.</p>
<p>We have already seen previously that the powerlaw exponent factor <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>
didn&#8217;t vary with the amount of Capping Protein in solution (<a class="pageref" href="#power-law-exponent">Fig  12</a>).

<p>The last parameter of our model is <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, the distance at which the force

<p>To determine the mechanical properties of the gel between the actin and the
probe bead, we model it as a purely elastic material. The viscous effects are
neglected in the approach part as the approach at different speed show no
clear effect on the approach curves (<a class="pageref" href="#many-speed">Figure  7</a>). We consider
the compression of the material between the two beads. The surface of the
compressed material is approximated by the projected surfaces of the bead along the
direction of compression (<span class="math">\(\pi R^2\)</span>).  The thickness of the compressed
material is taken as being the distance between bead centers corrected by the
distance offset <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> as any material below delta can be considered as
infinitively rigid for the optical tweezer.</p>
<p>The stress exerted onto the material projected onto the bead surface or radius

The geometry of the
system and the fluorescence signal suggest a decrease of the density of the

modulus. The value of this effective Young&#8217;s modulus are 3 orders of magnitude
smaller than the known elasticity of dendritic gels formed on beads that has been measured to be in the

<p>This difference in elasticity might explain why the mechanical actions of this actin cloud as not been

micro needle deformation or Atomic Force Microscopy indentation that have
sensitivities in the order of nN while the forces exerted by this actin cloud

<p>Similar to <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#morse1998a" id="id24">[Morse,  1998a]</a> we express the entanglement length as a
function of persistence length and filament density: <span class="math">\(L_e\approx L_p^{1/5} \rho^{-2/5}\)</span>. We can
reduce the expression of the Young&#8217;s modulus to a function of the following

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The Poisson Ratio <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span>,</li>
<li>The persistence length of actin filaments <span class="math">\(L_p\)</span></li>

<p>The Poisson ratio depends only on the powerlaw exponent and thus varies little
with the amount of Capping Protein concentration.  We found value of the
Poisson ratio that are between 0.1 and 0.2 corresponding to compressible
foam-like materials that do not expand highly in the direction orthogonal to
the compression axis. Previous study of bulk actin network find a Poisson
ration of 0.5 (incompressible material) for actin concentration of 21.5 µM.  We
suspect that the low actin concentration used in our experiments (4µM) is the
reason for the low Poisson Poisson Ratio. Also the local structure of filaments
emanating from the  bead may explain the large compressibility of our actin
cloud.</p>

<h3>Interpretation<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The results of our data analysis lead to the interpretation that
a dense actin gel of elasticity close to ~1kPa is polymerized
on the surface of the actin bead. This stiff gel
cannot be indented by the optical tweezer. Beyond this dense gel a soft
actin cloud with an effective elastic modulus of 1 Pa and below is
present and extends on distances that are several times bigger than the thickness
of the reconstituted actin cortex (<a class="pageref" href="#fig-interpretation">Fig  20</a>). The
structure of this actin cloud is expected to be quite different from the
dendritic gel and be mostly constituted of loosely entangle actin filaments.</p>
<p>In this model, the offset distance <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> correspond to the limit of the dense
dendritic actin network mimicking the actin cortex that grows on actin beads.
The high elastic modulus of this gel makes it impenetrable by the small forces generated by the optical tweezer we use. The
value of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> we found are coherent with the measured thickness <span class="math">\(e
\simeq \delta - 2.R_{bead}\)</span> of the  biomimetic actin cortex as measured by
epifluorescence in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id26">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a> and found to be in the range of 1 to 2 µm. The decrease
of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> with Capping Protein is also coherent with the decrease of gel
thickness.</p>
<p>The filaments composing the actin cloud emanate directly from the actin
cortex in which the nucleation of actin polymerisation started at the surface
of the bead. Eventually, a few filaments can escape from the network and are
capped by the Capping Protein only when the growing extremity is already several
micrometers from the bead surface.</p>

<h2>Relaxation phase<a class="headerlink" href="#id29" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The approach phase of the indentation cycle has been modeled with a purely
elastic mode. However, the force distance plot shows a significant dissipation
marked by an hysteresis <a class="pageref" href="#force-distance">Fig  4</a>. The repetitive indent cycle giving the same
force-distance curves (<a class="pageref" href="#reproc">Fig  6</a>) allow to exclude a plastic deformation.
We can hence reject the hypothesis of ruptures of the
actin meshwork or breakage near the entanglement points.</p>
<p>The theory of entangled filaments networks that allowed us to understand the link between the phenomenological
model and the mechanical properties of the network also proposes a relation to
explain the relaxation of the network.</p>
<p>In this model <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#morse1998a" id="id30">[Morse,  1998a]</a>, the visco elastic modulus  <span class="math">\(E\)</span> is a function of time
and can be written as <span class="math">\(E(t) = E\times \chi(t)\)</span> with</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-chi">
<span class="eqno">(15)</span>\[\chi(t)=\sum_{n, odd} \frac{8}{n^2 \pi^2}exp\left(- \frac{n^2\pi^2 t}{ \tau_{rep}} \right)\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(\tau_{rep} = \frac{l_f^2}{D_{rep}}\)</span> is a single fit parameter
that depends on diffusion constant for filament reptation <span class="math">\(D_{rep}\)</span> and the
filaments length <span class="math">\(l_f\)</span>. In this form, <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span> is a sum of
exponential decays with well defined characteristic timescales and amplitudes
that decrease as <span class="math">\(1/n^2\)</span>. To fit this model to the data of the
relaxation phase, we can limit ourselves to the first 40 terms of the sum as
any of the subsequents terms represent timescales we cannot reach with our
experimental resolution.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the value of <span class="math">\(\chi(t=0)\)</span> is 1 and should be
treated particularly in order to insure continuity of the force applied on the
actin-bead in the model.</p>
<p>Using this sum of exponential decays is coherent with the common findings of
power-laws found in the frequency-dependant shear modulus of both <cite>in vivo</cite> and <cite>in vitro</cite> actin
networks as well as the relaxation behavior found in cells.</p>
<p>In order to determine <span class="math">\(\tau_{rep}\)</span>, the Young&#8217;s modulus determined in the
approach phase is used and the model is fitted against the relaxation data.  A
result of such a fit can be seen on <a class="pageref" href="#fit-3-phases">figure  22</a>. The value of
<span class="math">\(\tau_{rep}\)</span> are highly variable and the fit can be difficult when the relaxation is
slow or in the order of the measured noise. Variation of <span class="math">\(\tau_{rep}\)</span> with the
concentration in Capping Protein can be seen on <a class="pageref" href="#tau-violin">figure  23</a>, and

<h2>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in many cellular functions.  The
actin cortex, just beneath the cell membrane is not only a crucial structure
for cell motility and the mechanical properties of the cell, it is also an essential
component in cell division and the positioning of the spindle.
Other actin structures, that spawn from the nucleus to the cell membrane are
responsible for cell organelle positioning like in plants where the nucleus is found
towards the anticlinal wall of the cell <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#iwabuchi2010" id="id33">[Iwabuchi, Takagi,  2010]</a>, or during
nurse cell maturation where the nucleus is pushed away from the dumping channel:cite:<cite>Huelsmann2013</cite>. The mechanical link from the
outside of the cells to the nucleus using actin bundles has already been show previously
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#jaalouk2009" id="id34">[Jaalouk, Lammerding,  2009]</a>. We show here that these actin structure should not be the
only one taken into account to explain organelles positioning.</p>
<p>Our experiments show the existence of a sparse and stiff actin cloud emanating
from a biomimetically reconstituted actin cortex.  This actin cloud is capable
of staining forces of tens of pico Newtons, enough to hold organelles in place. Using polymer physics
we are able to model the behavior of such an actin cloud and
measure many of its mechanical properties. It provides an
actin scaffold capable of deforming non-plastically. At time scale of few
seconds if behaves mostly elastically with an elastic module of a few Pascal.
The Poisson ratio of the actin cloud varies from 0.1 to 0.2 hinting for a
sparse structure of loosely entangle filaments forming a meshwork with a
typical mesh size of 300 to 400 nm.</p>
<p>The filaments at the origin of this loosely entangled network would emanate from
the dense actin cortex that can be seen and simulated on actin-beads
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id35">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a> and the evolution of parameters of this actin cloud are
coherent with the preceding studies on biomimetically reconstituted actin
cortices. Recently, the role of actin networks with similar properties as the
actin cloud have been described in cells such as <cite>Xenopus</cite> Oocyte
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#feric2013" id="id36">[Feric, Brangwynne,  2013]</a>. Poisson ratios of actin networks have been
measured in bulk to be higher <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id37">[Gardel, Valentine, Crocker,  et al.  2003]</a> but are not inconsistent with our measurement at lower actin concentration.</p>
<p>The actin cloud provides a novel structure that should be studied further to
understand the positioning of organelles in cells and to study which role this sparse
actin structure plays in the formation of other actin networks inside cells.</p>
<p>In particular microrheology experiments could be performed on the growing actin
cloud in order to further characterize the frequency dependence of the mechanical
properties  of the actin cloud. The effect of cross linking and network
branching is crucial for the occurrence of symmetry breaking on bead systems, and
would likely play a role in the structure of the actin cloud. A confined
geometry and direct polymerisation on membrane, or the effect of myosin motors
might allow to alter the properties of the actin cloud.</p>
<p>All these could be cellular mechanisms to use the actin cloud in order
to efficiently form structures needed for its function.
Further studies of the actin cloud on biomimetic or <cite>in vivo</cite> system are
challenging, but would lead to a better understanding of the mechanics of the
cells and its control.</p>
<p>A Paper based on this study has been accepted for publication in Biophysical
Journal and is added for information as appendix of this manuscript.</p>
