<h1>Preamble<a class="headerlink" href="#preamble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>During my PhD, I decided to investigate the effect of the actin network on the
mechanical properties of cells. Indeed, cell mechanics are a key parameter that
has crucial impact on cellular and organisms functions. Being able to detect
changes in the mechanical properties and to understand the mechanism that
governs these changes is an important step in the study of cellular behavior as
well as in the differentiation of healthy from cancerous cells and tissue.
Understanding the mechanisms that are at the origin of cell motion and shape
changes, is also a decisive step in controlling cell behavior, with the ultimate
goal to prevent cancer cell invasion and division without impairing healthy
cells.</p>
<p>During the last three years, I decided to focus on biomimetic systems and
to determine the characteristics of actin networks. Actin is a highly conserved
component across the living domain, and it plays a major role in cell
mechanics. By interacting with a number of other components of the cell, actin
is able to form various different types of networks. I decided to focus my research on such networks that were created under
controlled conditions.</p>
<p>Along this dissertation, we will mainly focus on three systems.</p>
<p>First, we reconstituted an already observed actin network —&nbsp;the actin
cortex — on a biomimetic system, then showed that a
second sparse actin network, which was previously unseen, emanates from it, and finally characterized its mechanical
properties. We developed the idea that the effect of this second network cannot
be neglected in cells and investigated a few of the phenomena it may be involved
in.</p>
<p>As the effect of such a sparse actin has not been demonstrated in living cells, we decided to
investigate the effect of another sparse actin network found in a living cells. In
collaboration with the group of Marie Hélène Verlhac at the College de France, we studied the mechanical properties
in the cytosol of mouse oocytes. We saw in this system that actin-related proteins had
hi-impact on the structure and the mechanics of both the cell and the actin
network.</p>
<p>Characterizing the dynamics of a network in a living cell by controlling the
conditions remains complex.  In a third research stream, we characterized the dynamical changes of tension created by reconstituted actin
cortices, that are linked to a lipid
membrane. By studying liposome &#8220;doublets&#8221;, we could measure the variation of tension generated by the acto-myosin cortex over
time. This system is composed by a liposome doublet covered with
an actin network. By imaging with Spinning disk microscopy, we could
reconstruct the changes in the acto-myosin network and deduce them in its
properties, from the geometrical variation during the network contraction.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cells are the basic components of living organisms. Understanding their
individual behavior and the way they function is a key step to understand
how they interact with their environment. One of the key components within most
cells is the actin cytoskeleton, which is made up of actin monomers, a highly conserved protein across species, which plays
an important role for cell mechanics, ranging from cell migration to cell differentiation
and division. Hence the crucial role it plays for the mechanical properties of
the cell and its mechanical interaction with the environment. Under the cell membrane lies a
thin actin network which controls the mechanical properties of the cell:
the actin cortex. The mechanical behavior of this actin cortex is itself driven
by the dynamics and interactions within the actin network it is made of.
So, understanding this actin network is a key to learn how the actin
cortex behaves, leading to a better understanding of cells and tissue.</p>
<p>The properties of an actin network highly depend on its structure. The
structure itself depends on many parameters that influence how the network is
formed.  The network structure and formation, influenced both by the physical and
chemical conditions and the spatial and temporal variation of these parameters, such as mechanical
stress or ion-concentration, can determine the fate of the network. It is
therefore important to study these networks and their dynamic behavior in order to grasp the
changing structure of the cell.</p>
<p>Cells are complex systems that adapt their shape, mechanical properties and
biochemical conditions permanently. The spatial repartition of these
properties is also variable as the cell regulates the concentration of proteins
all across its cytoplasm. In order to achieve a thorough study of the effect of each component independently,
it is crucial to study actin networks in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Biomimetic systems allow to respond to most of these concerns. First they provide a
controlled environment that mimics <cite>in-vivo</cite> phenomena. Second, biochemical conditions
can be well controlled, both in space and time, hence allowing to precisely fine tune
experimental conditions. Biomimetic systems are also particularly adapted to be combined with
optical traps, which allow us to study local mechanical properties of actin
networks with high temporal resolution. The combination of both allows us to get
insight into the variation of these mechanical properties as a function of
time and space, with high precision.</p>
<p>During my PhD, I have focused on the mechanical properties of branched actin
networks polymerizing on optically trapped polystyrene beads. Such networks have already been
studied before <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id1">[Kawska et al. 12]</a> but have been suspected to be highly
inhomogeneous. Optical traps allow to probe the mechanics of yet inaccessible parts of
the network.
I further studied actin
networks on other biomimetic systems constituted of liposomes, in order to better
understand the effect of actin cortex polymerisation on membrane tension and to
characterize network dynamics over time. Finally,  I participated in a
collaboration in order to understand the implication of such actin networks in
living mouse oocytes.</p>

<div class="section" id="living-cells">
<h2>Living Cells<a class="headerlink" href="#living-cells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cells are the basic building blocks of life, and all living beings are composed of
cells, from unicellular up to multicellular organisms like us. Unicellular
organisms must accomplish all their functions within a single cell. At the other end,
in multicellular organisms cells differentiate in order to accomplish specialised
tasks often by regrouping into organs. Despite sharing the same genetic
material, for each cell to accomplish a different task often requires different
mechanical properties. The variation of elasticity and other
mechanical properties of cells derive from the structure they are composed of.</p>
<p>Cells are hence able to adapt to their environment and develop functions and
behavior that may change over time. A small change of timing and/or biochemical
conditions can highly injure the development of an organism: for example modification of
the actin network at a given time during the cell cycle prevents symmetric division
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#lenart2005" id="id2">[Lenart et al. 05]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#vasilev2012" id="id3">[Vasilev et al. 12]</a>. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the substrate can
govern the differentiation of cells: Soft substrate will favor brain-tissue
cell, where stiff substrates increase the appearance of muscle cells
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#engler2006" id="id4">[Engler et al. 06]</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotypes, cells
have a common structure. The exterior of the cell is separated from the
inside by a plasma membrane. The interior of the cell is filled with the cytoplasm
which contains diverse structures such as organelles, genetic material, and
a large number of proteins that the cell uses to accomplish its functions. To
communicate with the outside, cells have a series of mechanisms that allow signals
and cargo to pass the membrane. This communication can be chemical, but
mechanics is also known to participate in the process. To sense their
mechanical environment, cells often use adhesion complexes to attach to the
substrate, and integrins as trans-membrane protein to transfer the force to the
cell cytoskeleton situated inside the cell. Chemical signals can either cross
the membrane through trans-membrane proteins, while endocytosis and exocytosis are
ways for the cell to import and export proteins and chemicals through its membrane.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oocyte">
<h2>Oocyte<a class="headerlink" href="#oocyte" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A particular cell type I was interested in during my PhD are mouse oocytes.
Oocytes are female germinal cells in the process of gametogenesis. Unlike
somatic cells that undergoes symmetric division via mitosis which leads to
two identical cells sharing the same genetic material, oocytes undergo a
different process called meiosis.  Meiosis in oocytes is a highly asymmetric
process necessary for the specificity of being large haploid
cells, containing at the end of meiosis only one chromosome of each pair
that constitutes the genetic material of a mouse. The second chromosome of each pair
will be provided during fertilisation of the oocyte by the male sperm.</p>
<p>The exact process of oocyte formation can vary among species, and in the following we will
describe the main mechanisms.</p>
<p>The complete process of egg maturation starts with primordial germ cells that
undergo mitosis to replicate until they enter the first meiosis (Meiosis I)
at which state they are called primary oocytes and are still diploid, that is to say still contains two chromosomes of each pair.</p>
<p>The primary oocyte will start maturation and growth and then undergo a first
asymmetric division just after prophase I.  This first division is asymmetric
both in the genetic material separation and in the unequal size of the formed
daughter cell. Indeed, the primary oocyte will divide into a secondary oocyte
and a polar body. Both, the secondary oocyte and the polar body are haploid and contain
only half of the genetic material of the primary oocyte.  The secondary oocyte
can go through Meiosis II in which it undergoes a second asymmetric division
and expulsion of a second polar body. These polar bodies will eventually degenerate
(<a href="#fig-asymetric-division">Fig  411</a>).</p>
<p>During meiosis, the process of cell division also differ from mitosis. Instead
of separating into two identically sized cells through the formation of a
cytokinetic ring, the primary oocyte will become the secondary oocyte by
expulsion a polar body. The formation expulsion of the polar body require
precise positioning of the cell organelles. During prophase I the nucleus of
the oocyte is carefully centered, undergoes a nuclear breakdown and spindle formation.
The first meiotic spindle will migrate toward the oocyte cortex along
its major axis. Once at the cortex, half of the genetic material of the spindle
will be expelled through the membrane forming the first polar body of much
smaller size than second oocyte.</p>
<p>Mouse oocyte are good model systems to study the mechanical properties inside
cells. They form big spherical cells with a diameter of around 80 µm
which allow to study the mechanical properties at different locations in
the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>In the third part of my PhD I participated in a collaboration with Marie-Hélène
Verlhac and Maria Almonacid at Collège de France who are interested in the
effect of actin dynamics in oocyte cytoplasm during the different parts of
oocyte gametogenesis.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 411: Asymmetric division of oocytes into polar bodies. The primary oocyte
asymmetrically divide into a secondary oocyte and a smaller polar body each
containing half the DNA of the mother cell. The secondary oocyte will
divide asymmetrically a second time to become the mature ovum while
expelling a polar body. This asymmetric division process allow the
formation of a large haploid cell. Adapted from Wikipedia –&nbsp;Gray&#8217;s

<h3>Cell Organelles<a class="headerlink" href="#cell-organelles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Inside the cytoplasm, cells have a number of structures with different and
specialised functions which are called organelles. The position and state of
organelles is of great importance for the cell to achieve its functions.
Probably the most known organelle is the cell nucleus of eukariotic cells that
contains the genetic material. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic
reticulum  which is the organelle responsible for translating
RNA coming from the nucleus to functional proteins that will be delivered
across the cell after maturation in vesicles. Theses vesicles are
transported across the cell both by dyneins and kinesins — molecular motors —
that walk along microtubules originating from the centriole part of the
centrosome but also by myosins walking along actin filaments.  All of those processes
consume energy in  the form of ATP, generated within the mitocondria spread
across the cytoplasm. A schematic of the cell with some organelles can be seen
on <a href="#albertcell">figure  412</a></p>
<div class="figure" id="albertcell">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/figure-1-30.jpg"><img alt="schematic of a cell" src="../_images/figure-1-30.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 412: Schematic of an eukariotic cell, adapted from <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#alberts2008" id="id6">[Alberts et al. 08]</a>. Visualized are
the many components that constitute the majority of cells.  Cell shape and
size can highly vary, from quasi spherical with a typical size of ten
micrometers to elongated neurones that can be tens of centimeters long.</p>
</div>
<p>The positioning of organelles is crucial for the life of the cell. During
meiotic division of cells, for example, it has been seen that the positioning of
the nucleus at the center of mouse oocytes happens before its
migration closer to the cortex to expel the first polar body. Failure to do so
results in a incorrect amount of DNA in germinal cell that can lead to
infertility.</p>
<p>It is already known that microtubules play a key role in organelle positioning.
Microtubules emanating from centrosome position at the two ends of the cell
during its division are used to fetch the correct chromosomes. Each
chromosome is pulled towards the centrosome which leads to each daughter
cell having the same amount of DNA.</p>
<p>Actin plays also an determinant role in organelle positioning process,
like in drosophila oocyte maturation where it positions the nurses cell away
from the dumping canal <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#huelsmann2013" id="id7">[Huelsmann et al. 13]</a>. In a later chapter (<a class="reference internal" href="#organelle-positioning"><em>Organelle
Positioning</em></a>) we will develop a few keys points where
actin is indispensable in organelle positioning and how this relate to the
biomimetic actin networks we reconstitute.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-cytoskeleton">
<span id="intro-cyto"></span><h3>The Cytoskeleton<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cytoskeleton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which gives
the shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that posses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how an organism moves. As feet, fins and
wings are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal
prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton will tell you many
things about a cell.</p>
<p>Unlike the (exo)-skeleton of animals which is rigid and
static, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keeps
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cells
move. Thanks to these dynamics, the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As vertebrates skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cytoskeleton is responsible not only to
transmit the forces the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses forces.
The cytoskeleton connect a cell to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.</p>
<p>We will consecrate a longer part of this work to describe the cytoskeleton.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-role-and-composition-of-the-cytoskeleton">
<span id="role-of-actin"></span><h2>The Role And Composition Of The Cytoskeleton<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-and-composition-of-the-cytoskeleton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have already introduced the cell cytoskeleton in the previous part, and we will now
describe its components and functionality more in detail here.  The cytoskeleton
has three main functions, it connects the cell both physically
and biochemically to the external environment, generate and coordinate the
forces that give the cell its shape and allows it to move. It is also
responsible for organising spatially  the cell content <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#fletcher2010" id="id8">[Fletcher et al. 10]</a>.
The cytoskeleton is also in particular sensitive to spatial and temporal
information that can affect cell fate and the assembly of the cytoskeletal
structure. This can be seen for example with the bud scar of budding yeast that
persists after division.</p>
<div class="section" id="composition-of-the-cell-cytoskeleton">
<h3>Composition of the cell cytoskeleton<a class="headerlink" href="#composition-of-the-cell-cytoskeleton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cytoskeleton is mainly composed of three types of filaments.
Microtubules, intermediate filament and actin filament, also known as
microfilaments.</p>
<p>Microtubules are the widest structure with a diameter of 20nm (<a href="#fig-mt">Fig  413</a>)
and the
stiffest of the three kinds of filaments with a <a class="reference internal" href="#viscoelastic"><em>persistence length</em></a> in the order
of millimeters, much longer than the size of the usual cell.
Microtubules are extensively studied <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#valiron2001" id="id9">[Valiron et al. 01]</a>.
Microtubules are formed by the polymerisation of a heterodimer of tubuline
that leads to the formation of polar (oriented) filaments that can be walked on
by molecular motors. These molecular motors can be decomposed in two families –
kinesins and dyneins – depending on the end towards which the motor preferably
walk.  Microtubules are mostly known for their action during mitosis
where they will form the majority of the mitotic spindle that drive the segregation
of the chromosomes in two groups, each group ending in one of the daughter
cells.</p>
<p>Microtubules have the characteristic of being highly dynamic by alternating
between two states of rapid growth and a rapid shrinkage. The transition from
microtubule growth to shrinkage is called a <cite>catastrophe</cite>, the transition from
shrinkage to growth is called a <cite>rescue</cite>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-mt">

</div>
<p>Intermediate filaments are of medium diameter in the order of around 10nm, in
between actin and microtubules filaments, hence their name.  Unlike microtubules
and actin filaments, intermediate filaments are composed by several sub-families
of proteins and are non-polar.</p>
<p>Intermediate filament have an important role in the mechanical properties of
cells due to the fact that they are particularly  resistant to stretching.</p>
<p>Unlike actin and microtubules, they are thought to be passive, with mechanical
properties mainly deriving from how multiple filaments are linked together
laterally.</p>
<p>Actin, is the third component of the cytoskeleton, the one on which  we will
focus on most of our efforts. Actin monomers, also called <cite>G-Actin</cite> for globular actin can polymerise.
By polymerizing actin monomers (G-actin) into actin filaments (<cite>F-actin</cite>), the
thinest of the three cytoskeletal components forms. Actin is produced in the
cell as a globular protein of ~40 kDa (<a href="#fig-actin">Fig  414</a>) that once associated with ATP or ADP
polymerises into helicoidal filament with a diameter between 7 and 9nm. The
formed actin filaments are polar, where both extremities are respectively called the
plus (<cite>+</cite>) or barbed end, and the minus (<cite>-</cite>) or pointed end. The polarity of
the actin filament is of importance as this gives rise to a preferred direction
for most processes that can happen on the filaments.</p>
<p>The actin protein is highly conserved across species, and is know to directly
interact with hundreds of proteins <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#dosremedios2003" id="id11">[DosRemedios et al. 03]</a>.</p>
<p>Single undecorated filaments will behave  as
semi-flexible polymers at the scale of the cell with a persistence length in the order of 10 µm <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#isambert1995" id="id12">[Isambert et al. 95]</a>. When they
assemble into different structures and networks, or associate with other proteins
and molecules the resulting mechanical and dynamic properties can be highly variable.</p>

<p>The assembly mechanisms that allow to go from single monomers of actin (also
refer to as G-actin for globular actin) to actin filament (also refer as
F-actin) need to be well understood to explain the different network
structures created by actin filaments in the presence of other proteins.</p>
<p>The polymerisation of ATP/ADP actin monomers to form an actin filament need to
go through the step of forming an actin proto-filament which is constituted of
at least 3 actin monomers. This will most of the time be the kinetically
limiting step. Once proto-filaments are present in solution, single monomers
can be freely added or removed on both ends of the filament.  The process of
forming these proto-filaments is called nucleation and it is the rate limiting
factor to form actin filaments. To circumvent this
limitation experimentally one can use preformed actin filament seeds, or actin nucleators
to direct the polymerisation on the cell.</p>
<p>We need to distinguish between the dynamics of polymerisation and
depolymerisation on both ends of the filament. Indeed, it has been show that the
association and dissociation rates are differ between the pointed (-) and
barbed (+) end. The barbed end has  higher dynamics than its pointed
counterpart which is the reason for its (+) name. The dynamics of
polymerisation is higher both in he case of ATP and ADP, though the rate
constant of association and dissociation differ for both kind of filaments (<a href="#fig-actin-pollard">Figure  415</a>)</p>

The difference of equilibrium constant between the barbed end (bottom)
and pointed end (top) in the presence of ATP allow filament treadmilling.</p>
</div>
<p>The equations that drive the polymerisation can be written as follow</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-roa1">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\begin{split}\left. \frac{dn}{dt} \right|_{barbed}&amp;= k_{+,{barbed}}.nGActin - k_{-,{barbed}} \\
\left. \frac{dn}{dt}\right|_{pointed}&amp;= k_{+,{pointed}}.nGActin - k_{-,{pointed}} \\\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Where <cite>barbed</cite> and <cite>pointed</cite> designate respectively the barbed and pointed end,
<span class="math">\(\left.\frac{dn}{dt} \right|_{barbed|pointed}\)</span> represent the variation of the number of actin
monomers in the actin filament which is due to addition or removal at the barbed
(respectively the pointed) end.
The association rate constant <span class="math">\(k_+\)</span> and dissociation ate constant <span class="math">\(k_-\)</span> are the polymerisation and de-polymerisation
rate.  The concentration in barbed and pointed-end denoted by
<span class="math">\(C_{{barbed}/{pointed}}\)</span>. By assuming that the number of pointed ends is
equal to the number of barbed ends, one can derive the steady state which give
rise to the critical monomer concentration below which an actin filament cannot
grow: <span class="math">\([GActin]_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rate constants of elongation of actin have been determined and depend on
whether the monomer is bound to ADP or ATP <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pollard1986" id="id16">[Pollard 86]</a>. We should
consider the fact that the  ATP bound to actin will hydrolyse to ADP-Pi before releasing
the inorganic phosphate. The hydrolysis and phosphate release rates also depend on whether the
monomer is part of a filament or in solution. The hydrolysis of ATP-bound
actin into ADP bound actin in the filament  leads to an imbalance of actin
(de)-polymerisation on both ends. The actin filaments preferably
grow from the barbed end and shrink preferably from the pointed end.</p>
<p>This will lead to a phenomenon known as treadmilling where a single actin
monomer bound to an ATP molecule, will be incorporated at the <cite>+</cite> end of the
filament and progressively migrate toward the <cite>-</cite> end, eventually hydrolysing its
ATP into ADP before detaching from the filament on the pointed end. During this
process the filament will grow / shrink until it reaches the stationary state
where its length would stay constant but the treadmilling continues.</p>
<p>Treadmilling requires an imbalance in the global rate constant on the barbed and
pointed end and an energy source, in the case of actin this is provided by the
hydrolysis of ATP into ADP+Pi before releasing the inorganic phosphate, without
which treadmilling would not occur.</p>
<p>Practically, this can be approximated by having only ATP monomers at the barbed
end of actin filaments while the pointed end is typically constituted only of
ADP monomers, thus the critical concentration is lower at the  pointed end
compared to the barbed end. The growth speed of the filament on both
ends depends on the monomer concentration in solution. In between the
critical concentration of both ends, there exists a concentration at which the
polymerisation on (+) exactly compensates the depolymerisation on (-).</p>

<h4>Actin network can be controlled by a host of actin binding proteins<a class="headerlink" href="#actin-network-can-be-controlled-by-a-host-of-actin-binding-proteins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Despite the already complex process of actin polymerisation and the
number of parameters that we have already introduced, the formation of an actin
network is an even more complex process that involves many other components.
Especially, actin monomers and filaments can interact with a high number of
proteins that will affect the previously introduced dynamics.  We will present
some categories of such proteins in the following.</p>
<div class="section" id="formins">
<h5>Formins<a class="headerlink" href="#formins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p><cite>Formins</cite> are polymerase proteins that will increase the polymerisation rate
of actin filaments by dimerizing and binding to the barbed end. It has the
particularity of being processive, meaning that it will stay bound to the
barbed end while catalysing the addition of new monomers. The processivity of
formins also permits the control of the localization of actin polymerisation
where formin proteins are present, like the tip of filopodia <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#faix2006" id="id17">[Faix et al. 06]</a>
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#bornschlogl2013" id="id18">[Bornschlogl 13]</a>. <cite>Formins</cite> posses domains rich in proline, capable of
binding to profilin (<cite>FH1</cite>) which allows formin to elongate F-Actin using actin
monomers bounds to profilin <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pruyne2002" id="id19">[Pruyne et al. 02]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pring2003a" id="id20">[Pring et al. 03]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="capping-protein">
<h5>Capping Protein<a class="headerlink" href="#capping-protein" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To regulate polymerisation, cells also have the possibility to reduce or stop
the polymerisation. To achieve this, some proteins will bind to the growing end
of actin filaments and prevent the addition of new monomers.  <cite>Capping Protein</cite>
(CP) being one particular example that will specifically bind to the barbed end
of a growing filament and  prevent it from growing. Capping proteins are
necessary to prevent polymerisation of actin in undesired area
and are essential for the structure and mechanical properties of actin gel
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id21">[Kawska et al. 12]</a>. <cite>Gelsoline</cite> is another example of Capping Protein, that
unlike CP can only attached to the barbed end of an actin filament after
severing it. Gelsoline is hence both a severing and a Capping Protein.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cross-linkers">
<h5>Cross-linkers<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-linkers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>We have seen that some proteins were able to attach to actin filaments. When
such a protein is able to attach to many filament at once, it can act as an
attachment point between the two filament, preventing them to move with respect
one to each other. Such proteins, are referred to as cross-linkers.</p>
<p>The amount of freedom in movement between the two filaments depends on the
cross-linker used. For example , α-actinin will allow rotation of the two
filament at their anchoring point whereas cross-linkers like fascine will prefer
a parallel conformation of the filament and favor the formation of actin
bundles.</p>
<p>Cross-linkers are essential for the formation of elastic network as they allow
forces to be carried from one actin filament to the other. The quantity of
cross link of a network will often be a key parameter for the elastic properties.
The distance between the link points in the network (both cross links
and entanglement points) will give the typical network mesh-size which is used
to calculate the viscoelastic response of networks : <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#morse1998a" id="id22">[Morse 98a]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="stabilizing-actin-filaments">
<h5>Stabilizing actin filaments<a class="headerlink" href="#stabilizing-actin-filaments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As actin networks are dynamic constructs that are changing shape and properties
over time, it is convenient to be able to stabilize those networks. Tropomyosins
are proteins capable to bind on the side of actin filament to stabilize them.</p>
<p>The use of phalloidin, a toxin extracted from fungus (Amanita phalloides), binds
between F-actin subunits on the filament, and hence  prevents it from
de-polymerising.  Though, it is known that stabilizing actin filaments with
phalloidin will increase their stiffness as measure by the persistence length which can change the
mechanical properties of the formed actin network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="profilin">
<h5>Profilin<a class="headerlink" href="#profilin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Profilin is a protein that will bind to the barbed end of single monomers of
actin in solution.  By doing so it will first prevent the association of
monomers into dimers and trimmers, thus preventing the nucleation of actin
filament. It thus allows a better control of localisation of actin filament
both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of actin seeds of actin nucleator.</p>
<p>Profilin was for a long time believed to be only a sequestering protein
that inhibit polymerisation <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#yarmola2009" id="id23">[Yarmola et al. 09]</a>, though it has a more complex
behavior, and if it prevent polymerisation of actin filaments by the pointed
end, it can facilitate polymerisation. One of the cause of increase in
polymerisation speed by profilin is the fact it binds preferably to ADP-Actin
and increase the exchange rate of ADP into ATP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="branching-agent">
<h5>Branching Agent<a class="headerlink" href="#branching-agent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A type of network found of the leading edge of cells lamellipodia is dendritic
network. It is characterised by tree-like structure of actin filaments in which
thanks to the Arp2/3 complex branching agent a mother actin filament will form a
daughter filament on its side.</p>
<p>We have seen previously that crosslinkers are proteins capable of linking two
or more actin filaments together by binding on their side. Another mechanism
involving binding on the side on actin filament is responsible for a closely
related network, the branching mechanism.</p>
<p>The Arp2/3 complex is composed of seven subunits, two of which are highly
similar to actin, forming the Arp2 and Arp3 family for Actin Related Proteins,
giving the complex its name. Typically Arp2/3 will bind on the side of a pre-existing
actin filament, hence initiating the growth of a daughter filament with an angle of
70° to the mother filament. The newly created daughter filament pointed end
is terminated by the Arp2/3 complex that will stay attached to the mother
filament, thus increasing the number of available barbed end, without changing
the number of available pointed end. See Nature Review by Erin D. Goley and
Matthew D. Welch <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#goley2006" id="id24">[Goley et al. 06]</a> for  a longer review about the Arp2/3
complex.</p>
<p>In cells, the Arp2/3 complex needs to be activated by a Nucleation Promoting
Factor (NFP).  Among them is the  WASp protein (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
protein) and its neural homologue N-WASP which are from the same family as
SCAR/WAVE <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#machesky1999" id="id25">[Machesky et al. 99]</a>.  All these activators of Arp2/3 have in common a
WCA motif. The wild type protein need to be activated in order to activate Arp2/3.
The activation is done by a change in conformation that exposes the active
region and provides the first actin monomer necessary for nucleation of the
daughter filament (<a href="#fig-pwa-deploy">Figure  416</a>).  To circumvent the activation process of
these proteins, we use a reconstructed version of the protein that cut all
region before the poly-proline. This confer to pVCA the ability to be
permanently active. This region can also be replaced by streptavidin in order
to selectively bind pVCA to selected regions. Characterisation and more
detailed description of pVCA can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#noguera2012" id="id26">[Noguera 12]</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Unlike Cells that are able to control the localisation of actin nucleation
processes thanks to activation of WASp and its homologue, the &#8216;in vitro&#8217; control
of localisation of actin polymerisation is directly done by the localisation of
pVCA.</p>
<p>The network formed by Arp2/3 is called a dendritic network, and is in
particular found at the leading edge of the cell in the lamellipodia. It is
such a network that is present in the bead system we will study hereafter.</p>
<p>As for crosslinkers, dendritic networks are able to carry forces across single
actin filaments by the intermediary of Arp2/3. Two dendritic network of Arp2/3
can also entangle and allow forces to be carried across them

eventually be capped by Capping Protein (light-blue pairs of circle) which

<div class="section" id="molecular-motor">
<h5>Molecular Motor<a class="headerlink" href="#molecular-motor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A particular kind of protein that can bind to the cytoskeletal filaments are
molecular motors. Molecular motors are proteins that will consume energy
in the form of ATP, hydrolyse it to change conformation and produce forces.</p>
<p>The motors that move along actin filaments are part of the myosin superfamily, they
are both responsible for the transport of cargo along filaments, cell motility,
division, and muscle contraction. They acquire their name from their discovery
in 1864 by Willy Kühne who extracted the first myosin II extract from muscle
cell <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#hartman2012" id="id30">[Hartman et al. 12]</a>.</p>
<p>The myosin super family is divided into subfamilies numbered with roman literals.
As of today we count more than 30 families of myosin <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#berridge2012a" id="id31">[Berridge 12]</a>.
Muscle myosin is part of the myosin II family and is often referred to  as
conventional myosin for historical reason as being the first discovered.
Non-muscle  myosin are also referred to as unconventional myosin.</p>
<p>Myosin motors seem to be shared among the living domain, hinting for an
early emerging of myosin in the evolution. All the myosin motors move on actin
filaments toward the barbed end, with the exception of myosin VI which moves
towards the pointed end <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#buss2008" id="id32">[Buss et al. 08]</a>.</p>
<p>Different subfamily of myosin are used for different function in cells. Even in
subfamilies each type of myosin can have specific functions. For example,
conventional myosin found in muscle cells are use for large scale cell
contraction. In contrast, myosin V is known to transport cargo and is found to
be responsible for actin network dynamics and vesicle positioning
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#holubcova2013" id="id33">[Holubcova et al. 13]</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="myosin-ii">
<span id="myoii"></span><h6>Myosin II<a class="headerlink" href="#myosin-ii" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>As stated before, the myosin II family both encompass conventional myosin as
well as Non-muscle myosin II (NMII). Both have a similar structure (<a href="#fig-myosin">Fig  418</a>).</p>
<p>All myosin IIs are dimers constituted of two heavy chains and light chains. The
heavy chains are held together by a coil-coiled alpha helix referred to as the
tail. On the other side of the protein sequence is a globular head, which is
responsible for ATP hydrolysis and is able to convert the energy from the
hydrolysis into mechanical force. It is also the part that will bind to the
actin filaments. In between the tail and head is the neck domain that acts as a
lever to transmit the force generated by the head to the tail. The length of
the neck influences the length of the movement done by the cargo at each step of
the myosin as well as the size of the step the myosin can effect. The two light
chains are situated in the neck region and are responsible for the myosin
activity regulation.</p>
<p>Myosin II dimers can align and assemble by the tail region, forming myosin
minifilaments. These minifilaments are bipolar, having numbers of myosin head
with the same orientation at each extremity.</p>
<p>In the myosin II family, conventional myosin and NMII differentiate by the
size of the minifilaments they form. Muscle myosin will form minifilaments
aggregating around 200 dimers, where NMII minifilaments will be composed  only
of 10 to 20 minifilaments. The other characteristic of unconventional myosin
with muscle myosin is the mode of activation. Conventional myosin activity is
regulated by the amount of <span class="math">\(Ca^{2+}\)</span> available, which frees the actin filaments to let the myosin motor bind. However, its
counterparts are typically activated by the phosphorilation of the Myosin Light Chain (MLC).</p>
<p>Another parameter that discriminates muscle from non-cell myosin is their duty
ratio.  The duty ratio is define as the ratio of the time the myosin stays
attached to an actin filament over the typical time of a contraction cycle.
By noting <span class="math">\(\tau_{on}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\tau_{off}\)</span> the time the myosin head
spent attached/detached from  the filament, the duty-ratio or duty-cycle can
be noted :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-roa2">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[r = \frac{\tau_{on}}{\tau_{on}+\tau_{off}}\]</div>
<p>We will see in the following that the duty-ratio might have an important effect
on the processivity of the myosin.</p>
<p>It should be noted that as minifilaments can attach to actin filaments on both
ends, they can also act as a bridge that holds two points close to each other,
though having the properties of crosslinkers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="myosin-v">
<h6>Myosin V<a class="headerlink" href="#myosin-v" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>Myosin V is an unconventional myosin. Unlike myosin II it does not aggregate
into minifilaments.  Though, myosin V has a similar structure to myosin II but
with a longer neck, this confers to myosin V the ability to realize longer
steps on actin filaments. Indeed, the myosin V step size is of 36nm, which is close to the
twisting length of actin filaments. This allows myosin V motors to walk along
actin filament without having to rotate around it with the helix they form. At the end the tail domain
myosin V posses another globular domain capable of binding to its cargo, and
the variability of this region is what mostly define the difference between the
different type of myosin V.</p>
<p>Myosin V also has a high duty-ratio, this leads to dimers having almost always
one of the two head of the myosin to be bound to actin. It grants to the myosin
V the ability to walk in a processive manner toward the barbed end of
the actin filaments, both head successively binding 36 nm in front of the other
head.</p>

<div class="section" id="myosin-cycle">
<h6>Myosin cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#myosin-cycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>We saw earlier that the duty ratio of myosin was the ratio of time the head of
the myosin spent attached to the actin filament. Indeed, myosin can generate
displacement through a cycle of ATP hydrolysis and attachment/detachment
described below for a Myosin II motor:</p>
<p>The cycle can be decomposed in 5 steps, last of which will be responsible for
the forced exerted on the myosin cargo.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The myosin start in the &#8216;rigor&#8217; conformation where it is lightly bound to
the actin filament.</li>
<li>An ATP molecule binds to the myosin head inducing the detachment of the
myosin from the actin filament.</li>
<li>ATP molecule is hydrolysed into ADP+Pi, providing energy which is stored
into a conformational change of the myosin which effects a recovery
stroke.</li>
<li>Inorganic phosphate is released as the myosin head attaches to the actin
filament.</li>
<li>The actin-bound myosin change conformation, applying forces on it&#8217;s
cargo. This step is known as the power-stroke and is responsible for most
of the applied forces or displacements of the myosin. During the
power-stroke the ADP bound to the myosin head is released, leading back
to first step of the cycle.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This principle is the same for all kinds of myosins. In the case of Myosin II
the duty-ratio is only of about 5%, which leave Myosin II detached from the
actin filament most of the time. A single dimer cannot achieve
processivity.   The tail of myosin II can bundle itself with the tail of other
myosin II motors.  They from large bipolar thick filaments of hundreds of dimers.
As each myosin dimer attaches and detaches independently from the actin
network the effective attachment of of the filament increases with the number
of motors in the minifilaments. Indeed the probability of having at least one
motor attached increases with the number of motors. The constant attachment of
at least one myosin II head in minifilaments insure that the filament does not
displace with respect to the actin network when others myosin heads recover
from their power stroke and reattach, thus conferring processivity to myosin II
minifilaments.</p>
<p>The bipolar nature of myosin II minifilaments also allow them to act as force
dipoles, each  of the extremity pulling the surrounding actin network or
filament towards the center of the minifilaments. This is the mechanism at the
origin of muscle contraction and can allow to build-up tension in actin network.</p>

<h4>Lamellipodium based Motility<a class="headerlink" href="#lamellipodium-based-motility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We can ave a first look into the mesenchymal mode of locomotion of cells, which is
also often referred to as crawling. To understand how a cell is able to crawl,
to move itself, we will in particular take the example of the lamellipodium.
The lamellipodium is a characteristic structure found in cells moving on a 2D substrate. By
its nature, motion using lamellipodia is one of the easiest to study using
microscopy which might explain why it is one of the best know process of cell
displacement. None the less, it does not diminish its importance in tissues
behavior as all epithelial cell can be considered as moving on a 2D substrate.
Beyond lamellipodia, further structures that are responsible for cell motion are
filopodia and pseudopodia. They mainly differ from lamellipodia by their shape
and the organisation of the actin structure inside (<a href="#fig-schafer">Fig  420</a>). Lamellipodia-based motion
can move a cell up to a few micrometers per minute.</p>
<p>The action necessary to move in an mesenchymal way can be decomposed into three
steps. First the cell needs to grow a protrusion. Growing this protrusion is
typically governed by actin polymerisation just underneath the plasma membrane. The
lamellipodium is such a protrusion which is constituted by a 2D dendritic actin network
that polymerize at the leading edge. Second the cell&#8217;s protrusion
need to attach to the surface. This is done through trans membrane proteins
that are bound to the actin cortex on the inside of the cell. The actin cortex
will act as a scaffold to transmit the force across the cellular to these
anchor points. The last part is the generation of traction in which the rest of the cell is pulled
toward the attached protrusion. The traction force is mediated through the
cytoskeleton and actin cortex while the contraction force themselves can origin
from actin network contraction and reorganisation due to myosin motors (<a href="#fig-lam-principle">Fig  421</a>).</p>

<h4>Blebbing based Motility<a class="headerlink" href="#blebbing-based-motility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The second mode of motility which is known as amoeboid is more characteristic
of 3D displacement of cells. In this mode, the cell will also form protrusions
but will not rely on adhesion to move its body. This motility rely on blebs,
that are blister-like protrusion that appear on the cell surface. A bleb
forms on the surface of cell when the membrane detach from the actin
cytoskeleton underneath it, or when the cortex ruptures (<a href="#fig-bleb">Fig  422</a>). The small protrusions
are formed, quickly grow as they lack the force supporting layer that the actin
cortex provides. While growing, the bleb fills with cytosol. The actin
cortex can rapidly reform on the bleb slowing down its growth. In some cases,
the reformation of the actin cortex in the bleb and the rebuilding of the
tension inside the bleb by myosins mediated contraction is enough to reverse
the bleb. Though, the content of the cell can also drain itself into the bleb
as it grows and while the main body of the cell contract and empties, thus
moving the cell from its old position to a new one in the direction of the
initial growth of the bleb.</p>
<p>At their initial state, blebs are simple membrane protrusions filled with
cytosol and empty of organelles. The stop of their growth is due to the
spontaneous formation of an actin cortex on the inner side of the bare
membrane.</p>
<p>By their relative simplicity to the rest of the cells, blebs are the perfect
system to be reconstituted <cite>in vitro</cite> in liposomes.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 422: Formation of bleb can be done either by a) detachment of the membrane from
the cytoskeleton, or b) by a rupture of the cytoskeleton. In both cases the
inner pressure of the cell leads to the inflation of the membrane at the

the inside of the bleb slowing down its growth until the expansion stops.

<span id="id41"></span><h3>Organelle Positioning<a class="headerlink" href="#organelle-positioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have seen previously that organelle positioning plays an important role in
cell function.  Several mechanisms involving actin are at the origin of
structure positioning in cells. The positioning of organelles by actin can have
a wide impact from being necessary for the correct cell division, to
allowing locust eyes to adapt in the dark by repositioning mitocondrion
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#sturmer1995" id="id42">[Sturmer et al. 95]</a>.</p>
<p>We already know that the actin cortex is a necessary element in cell
motility. It also plays a determinant  role in organelle
positioning. It has been shown  <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#chaigne2013a" id="id43">[Chaigne et al. 13]</a> that the correct range
of elasticity of the actin cortex during oocyte division is needed for proper spindle
positioning. The correct spatial position of this spindle is necessary to
perform a viable division of the cell.</p>
<p>The actin cortex is not the only actin structure in the cell, beyond the thin and
dense layer just below the membrane lies a softer and sparser actin structure that has a
crucial role in organelle positioning.</p>
<p>During cell division, there are several stages that require actin structures.
As shown previously <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#azoury2011" id="id44">[Azoury et al. 11]</a> the expulsion of polar body during
oocyte asymmetric division is  strongly dependent on the time evolution of a
sparse actin network that can be found in the cell. Actin structures are  also
required at a later stage to permit the correct capture of chromosomes by
microtubules and achieve correct haploid division.  <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#schuh2008" id="id45">[Schuh et al. 08]</a> also shows
that a similar sparse actin network contracted by myosins is necessary for
spindle migration.</p>
<p>Especially in oocyte that are typically large, the effect of gravity is not
negligible. The presence of a sparse &#8220;actin scaffold&#8221; is discussed in
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#feric2013" id="id46">[Feric et al. 13]</a>, where it is found that an actin network is present to
balance the gravitational force.</p>
<p>In drosophila, nurses cell need to expel their content into oocytes. It has been
observed <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#huelsmann2013" id="id47">[Huelsmann et al. 13]</a> that during this phase, the nurse cells&#8217; nucleus
is pushed away from the dumping canal by single actin filaments polymerising
from the membrane and forming a soft and sparse actin network.</p>

<h2>In vitro reconstituted actin networks<a class="headerlink" href="#in-vitro-reconstituted-actin-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Living cells are complex organisms, for which each function requires a number
of interacting proteins and components. To understand the action of each
individual component, it is necessary to isolate or modify their actions
independently.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the precise tuning of each component independently, two
approaches are possible. First, an approach referred to  as &#8220;Top-Down&#8221;, where
starting from the full system — in our case the cell —&nbsp;we will modify or remove
single or multiple components and study the global change of behavior. This is a complex
process that might be difficult to interpret, as biological systems often have
multiple pathways and feedback loops to regulate each of their processes. Taking into account the
large number of components that constitute a living cell, it is also
difficult to come up with the minimal system required to replicate certain behaviors.</p>
<p>The other approach, also referred to as the bottom-up approach, requires
the reconstitution of the system part by part until it replicates the expected
behavior. This is also a complex process, as there is a large number of potential components
likely to be added to the reconstituted system. This vast complexity
often leads to a wide range of testable parameters.
These controlled systems allow in principle for a deeper understanding of the governing
working mechanisms, and often permit access to a wider range of accessible
conditions and individual tweaking of components.</p>
<p>In our lab, we are mainly interested in the bottom-up approach and the use of
biomimetic systems. We try to reconstitute biologically relevant behavior within
minimal systems,  constituted from pure protein components.</p>
<p>I       n this manuscript in particular, we focus on mimicking the motility process
by which the <cite>listeria</cite> pathogen is able to hijack cellular mechanisms, by recruiting proteins
responsible for actin polymerisation at the leading edge of the cell, and use
them to polymerize actin on the pathogen surface. This is what allows &#8216;listeria&#8217; to
propel itself fast enough (1.5 to 2 µm /min) <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#dabiri1990" id="id48">[Dabiri et al. 90]</a> to be able to
penetrate the cell membrane to move from one cell to the other.</p>
<p>The bead motility system is a minimal <cite>in-vitro</cite> system capable of replicating
the listeria motility.</p>
<div class="section" id="bead-motility-assay">
<span id="id49"></span><h3>Bead motility assay<a class="headerlink" href="#bead-motility-assay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <cite>Listeria</cite> pathogen is a 1.5 to 5 micrometer cylindrical bacteria that
enters cells, hijacks its actin polymerisation machinery to propel itself and
infect neighbour cells. It does so by the recruitment of a single protein on its
surface : ActA, that activates the Arp2/3 complex. By the recruitment of Arp2/3, a
dense branched and entangled actin network grows that will eventually form a
comet behind the bacteria propelling it at the speed of actin comet
polymerisation. Listeria comets are composed of a wide range of proteins. It has
been shown <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#loisel1999" id="id50">[Loisel et al. 99]</a> that the number of required components can
be highly reduced, still maintaining the motility features.</p>
<p>A simpler system replicating the listeria motility is the bead motility assay.
Consisting of a micrometer-sized bead covered with a nucleation promoting factor (NPF), it will activate the Arp2/3, present in the solution.</p>
<p>In the case of listeria, this NPF can be ActA, but such other NPF such as N-WASp or pVCA can also be used.
We chose pVCA in the experiments presented in this work. The NPF covered
bead is mixed with a G-Actin solution. Capping Protein is added to prevent
polymerisation from happening away from the bead surface as well as the
components required for actin polymerisation (ATP, Salt..., see <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#m-et-m"><em>Material and methods</em></a>)</p>
<p>Due to the presence of Capping Protein in the solution and NPF on the surface of
the bead, the polymerisation of actin will only happen
on the bead surface, forming a thin and dense actin gel capable of sustaining stress, depending
on the different protein concentrations. Unlike listeria, which
seems to control on which of its sides the nucleation process happens, this is not
controlled in bead motility assays. In the right condition, though,
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id51">[Kawska et al. 12]</a> the dense actin gel formed on the bead surface can
accumulate the stress induced by the inner layer polymerisation, until symmetry
breaking occurs. The gel ruptures on one side of the bead, leading to
the formation of a comet on the opposite side (<a href="#fig-bead-motility">Figure  423</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-bead-motility">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Plastino-Sykes-2005.png"><img alt="../_images/Plastino-Sykes-2005.png" src="../_images/Plastino-Sykes-2005.png" style="width: 60%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 423: Scheme of bead motility assay. The NPF (yellow stars) will localize the
actin polymerisation on the surface of the bead, thus increasing the stress on
the outer actin layer. At a sufficient level of stress, the outer layer
ruptures, leading to symmetry breaking, formation of a comet, and
propulsion of the bead. Adapted from <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#plastino2005" id="id52">[Plastino et al. 05]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Due to the further polymerisation of the actin network on the surface of the bead,
the comet will grow, propelling the bead forward. This is the reason why the bead
system is a biomimetic system replicating the listeria motion.</p>
<p>It should be noted that during the movement of this system, two phases can be
distinguished. In the first phase, the system presents a spherical symmetry with
an homogeneous actin  network around the bead. The gel is growing from the
surface and is accumulating stress, due to the polymerisation of inner layers.</p>
<p>If the gel has accumulated sufficient stress by polymerisation,  the symmetry breaking event happens, and the system enters into
a second phase with the formation of a comet.</p>
<p>The conditions that lead to symmetry breaking have been investigated in detail
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id53">[Kawska et al. 12]</a>. In the absence of Capping Protein, the actin polymerisation
does not seem to be restricted enough near the surface of the bead, and thus the formed
network is not able to generate or sustain enough stress to achieve symmetry
breaking. At high Capping Protein concentration, the growth of the gel is heavily impaired,
thus preventing symmetry breaking. The concentration of Arp2/3 is also critical,
as Arp2/3 forms branched networks, and these branched networks are primordial essential for the
ability to sustain stress.</p>

<p>In the rest of this chapter, we use the bead motility system, but only
consider it during the first phase, where the symmetry breaking has not yet
occurred, or in condition where it should not occur. In particular, we will
investigate a condition at 25 nM Arp2/3 with a concentration of Capping Protein
varying from 0 to 50 nM. As shown in <a href="#phase-diag">fig  424</a> this range corresponds to
conditions where no symmetry breaking occurs, but also to conditions in which
symmetry breaking is expected.  It should be noted that unlike
other studies that also characterize actin network growing on beads
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pujol2012" id="id55">[Pujol et al. 12]</a>, our system is still dynamically polymerising and thus
changing with time.</p>

<h3>Liposomes<a class="headerlink" href="#liposomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Beads are used as a model biomimetic system that replicates the polymerisation mechanism
happening on the leading edge of cells. Because of their composition and
rigidity, the phenomenon observed on beads cannot necessarily reproduce all the interactions and
processes that take place on the cell membrane. Cells are finite compartments with a
limited amount of actin that acts on the dynamics of polymerisation.  The fact
that cell size is in the order of the persistence length of actin filaments
also plays a role on the structure of actin networks. Indeed, at these scales, a
single filament can never reach the length at which it can be considered fully
flexible.</p>
<p>Liposomes are one of the biomimetic systems able to capture some
interactions between cell membranes. Liposomes are lipid bilayers that imprison
an aqueous compartment and exhibit many characteristics similar to cells.
The inside of liposomes can act as a biochemical reactor of limited size, with
the lipid bilayer acting as a separation from the outside, like the cell
membrane. The composition of the lipid layer can be varied in order to reflect
the composition of a cell membrane. In particular, it is possible to attach
proteins to the liposome membrane. Finally, the size of the liposomes can be
varied, leading to actin networks, the size and shape of which are similar to those found in
cells.</p>
<p>It is possible to mimic the cellular actin cortex using liposomes, and especially
its contractility. A crosslinked actin network can be formed and attached to
the outer leaflet of liposomes, and contractility can be triggered by injecting
molecular motors. The behavior of the system will depend on the attachment
between the reconstituted actin cortex and the liposome membrane.  A weak attachment
leads to a favorable rupture of the actin cortex during the increase of tension,
implying a symmetry breaking, as in the bead motility system.  In the case of strong
attachment, the liposome actin-cortex will accumulate tension until it has
enough force to crush the supporting lipid layer, thus collapsing the liposome

<span id="id66"></span><h3>Elastic Modulus<a class="headerlink" href="#elastic-modulus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The elastic moduli are probably the easiest to understand. They are
characteristic of how a material will deform non-permanently under an applied
force. The stiffer something is, the higher its elastic moduli will be. There
are two specific elastic moduli of interest in this
manuscript, <cite>Young&#8217;s Modulus</cite> and <cite>shear modulus</cite>. The first one describes how a material will react to compression or extension, while the
second describes how a material resists  shearing. For isotropic and homogeneous
materials, the Young&#8217;s modulus (E) and the shear models (G) are related
by the Poisson&#8217;s ratio (<span class="math">\(\nu\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa7">
<span class="eqno">(10)</span>\[G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}\]</div>
<p>Both G and E units are homogeneous to <span class="math">\(N/m^2\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(Pa\)</span>.  It is instructive to have an idea of the order of magnitude of a
few usual materials. Aluminium will have an elastic modulus <span class="math">\(G_{Al}\simeq
70~GPa\)</span> while rubber will be more in the order of <span class="math">\(G_{rubber}\simeq
0.1~GPa\)</span>. The elastic modulus of muscle cell is in the order of
<span class="math">\(G_{muscle} \sim 10~kPa\)</span> and brain tissues around <span class="math">\(G_{brain} \sim
0.1~\text{to}~1~kPa\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#engler2006" id="id67">[Engler et al. 06]</a>.</p>
<p>A  more formal definition of the Young&#8217;s modulus is the ratio between
the stress <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> along the direction of the deformation and the relative deformation <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa8">

deformation, the relative change of length is proportional to the applied
force. Here, the material can be seen to expand/contract in the orthogonal direction
to the direction of the, applied force. In the case of an
incompressible material (<span class="math">\(\nu = 0.5\)</span>) this can be seen as the
conservation of the material volume.</p>

<p>Other characteristic numbers can also be defined, such as the bulk modulus. In the case of isotropic
elastic materials, only two of those parameters are required to completely define
the properties of the material.</p>

<div class="section" id="poisson-s-ratio">
<h3>Poisson&#8217;s Ratio<a class="headerlink" href="#poisson-s-ratio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have seen that the shear modulus is linked to the Young modulus using
the Poisson&#8217;s ratio. It is another characteristic of a material
that defines how much a material will compress/expand in the orthogonal directions to its elongation.
The Poisson&#8217;s ratio is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa10">
<span class="eqno">(13)</span>\[\nu = - \frac{
    d \epsilon_{trans}

<p>In which <span class="math">\(\epsilon_{axial}\)</span> is the relative deformation along one of the
axis of compression/elongation and <span class="math">\(\epsilon_{trans}\)</span> corresponds to the
relative deformation along an axis, orthogonal to the axis of deformation.</p>
<p>Volume conservation during compression or elongation requires
a Poisson&#8217;s ratio of <cite>0.5</cite>. Such values have been found in bulk measurements of
actin networks at actin concentrations of 21.5 µM in G-actin <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id68">[Gardel et al. 03]</a>. Materials with a Poisson&#8217;s ratio of <cite>0.5</cite> are
said to be incompressible. A Poisson&#8217;s ratio lower than <cite>0.5</cite> corresponds to materials
expanding less than incompressible materials, and some cells and tissues are known to
have a Poisson&#8217;s ratio lower than 0.5 <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#mahaffy2004" id="id69">[Mahaffy et al. 04]</a>. Another critical value
is 0, where the materials only expand or contract in the direction of the
main stress.</p>
<p>Materials with a Poisson&#8217;s ratio superior to 0.5 would show a bigger
deformation in the orthogonal direction than incompressible materials, leading
to a global volume increase, if compressed.</p>

<div class="section" id="viscosity">
<h3>Viscosity<a class="headerlink" href="#viscosity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Like elasticity, viscosity is something tangible we are used to work with in
everyday life. The more viscous a material is, the more difficult it is to move
something in it, at high speed. And indeed, viscosity is the pendant of the elastic
modulus, but considering forces induced by the deformation rate instead of displacement</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa12">
<span class="eqno">(14)</span>\[\begin{split}\frac{F}{S} &amp;= \tau_{xy} \\
            &amp;= \eta \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(\tau_{xy}\)</span> is the shear stress, <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is the force exerted
on the surface <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> is the viscosity, and is expressed in
<span class="math">\(Pa.s\)</span>, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the deformation rate along the direction <span class="math">\(z\)</span> .</p>
<p>At room temperature, water has a viscosity of around 1 mPa.s, and honey of 10 Pa.s. The consideration of viscosity in problems will
often depend on the timescale and deformation rate. At a short
timescale, tissue often behaves elastic, whereas at a long timescale, the effect
of viscosity will be seen <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#thoumine1997" id="id70">[Thoumine et al. 97]</a>. In actin networks, the effect of
viscosity at short time scale can be similar to elasticity <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id71">[Gardel et al. 03]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="viscoelasticity">
<h3>Viscoelasticity<a class="headerlink" href="#viscoelasticity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Typically, no material is purely elastic or purely viscous. While glaciers
seem purely solid at the time scale of a few days, observation on a longer time
scale, ranging from months to years, show that ice is not only a
solid, but can also flow. Of course, ice in its solid form is not the only
material which is both solid and viscous. In order to describe such
behaviour, one can use the theory of viscoelastic materials.  A number of models have
been and are still developed to describe viscoelastic behavior. The
Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell models are two of the simpler ones (<a href="#fig-mkv">Figure  430</a>). A thought
experiment, conducted to understand each of these models, consists of putting a spring and a dash pot
in parallel or series. Such model systems exhibit viscoelastic behavior.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-mkv">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/MKV.png"><img alt="../_images/MKV.png" src="../_images/MKV.png" style="width: 70%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 430: Maxwell model schematic on the left and Kelvin-Voigt model on the right.
Both are simple approaches to express the properties of a viscoelastic
solid. The response to a creep compliance will differ in both cases. The Maxwell
model will mostly behave like a fluid with viscosity <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> after a
long time, whereas the Kelvin-Voigt model will mostly reflect the elastic
components at constant exerted stress. (Schematic in Public Domain, adapted
from Wikimedia).</p>
</div>
<p>The idea for more complex models is similar: any material can be considered as an
(infinite) combination of springs (for elasticity), and dash-pots, (for viscosity).</p>
<p>The theory of viscoelastic materials explains the mechanical properties of a system by
using a single parameter: the viscoelasticity of a material. This can
be done by describing <span class="math">\(E\)</span> as a relaxation modulus depending on time.  In
the case of a linear system, we can express the strain on the material at a given
time, as a function of its history :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-strain">
<span class="eqno">(15)</span>\[\sigma (t)  = \int_{-\infty}^t E(t-\tau) \frac{du}{d\tau} d\tau\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(\sigma(t)\)</span> is the time dependent stress, and <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span> is
the known strain.</p>
<p>Through the use of rheology, it is common to measure the properties of a material using a
sinusoidal strain of known amplitude <span class="math">\(u_0\)</span> and frequency <span class="math">\(f =
\omega/ 2.\pi\)</span> : <span class="math">\(u(t) = u_0.cos(\omega t)\)</span>, which also implies a
sinusoidal strain rate. Using the complex notation <span class="math">\(\dot u = u_0 i\omega
e^{i\omega t}\)</span> in equation <a href="#equation-strain">(15)</a>, and operating the change of variable <span class="math">\(t-\tau \to t'\)</span>  leads to :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa13">
<span class="eqno">(16)</span>\[\sigma(t) = u_0\int_0^\infty E(t') i\omega e^{i\omega(t-t')}dt'\]</div>
<p>By factoring out the time dependent part, the rest can be rewritten as two integrals with respectively a real and an imaginary prefactor:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqt">
<span class="eqno">(17)</span>\[\sigma(t) = u_0e^{i\omega t}\times\left(
          \omega \int_0^\infty E(t')  sin(\omega t) dt'
          +
        i \omega \int_0^\infty E(t') cos(\omega t) dt'
\right)\]</div>
<p>The two integrals in brackets only depend on the pulsation <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> and the properties of the considered material.
They are both in factors of the complex strain <span class="math">\(u(t) = u_0 e^{i\omega t}\)</span>.
We thus define the storage modulus of the material as the real part of (<a href="#equation-eqt">(17)</a> in bracket) <span class="math">\(E'\)</span> :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa14">
<span class="eqno">(18)</span>\[E'(\omega) =  \omega \int_0^\infty E(t')  sin(\omega t) dt'\]</div>
<p>And the loss modulus as the imaginary part of (<a href="#equation-eqt">(17)</a> in bracket)</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa15">
<span class="eqno">(19)</span>\[\begin{split}E&quot;(\omega) =  \omega \int_0^\infty E(t')  cos(\omega t) dt'\end{split}\]</div>
<p>And define the complex frequency dependent Young&#8217;s modulus as :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa16">
<span class="eqno">(20)</span>\[\begin{split}E^*(\omega) = E'(\omega) + i.E&quot;(\omega)\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Thus we can write <a href="#equation-eqt">(17)</a> as :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa17">
<span class="eqno">(21)</span>\[\sigma(\omega) = E^*(\omega).u(\omega)\]</div>
<p>In this representation of <span class="math">\(E^*(\omega)\)</span>, the real part will correspond to
the elastic response of the material (in-phase response
under oscillatory strain) and the imaginary part corresponds to the viscous response
of the system (out of phase under sinusoidal strain). The complete knowledge of
<span class="math">\(E^*(\omega)\)</span> at all frequencies completely characterizes the material.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Models for actin networks have been extensively studied as viscoelastic material
both theoretically <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#morse1998a" id="id72">[Morse 98a]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kruse2005" id="id73">[Kruse et al. 05]</a> , and  experimentally
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#mizuno2007" id="id74">[Mizuno et al. 07]</a>. Actin networks have also been shown to exhibit linear characteristic behavior,
but at certain concentration ranges, a non-linear behavior has also been observed <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#yao2011" id="id75">[Yao et al. 11]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#gardel2003" id="id76">[Gardel et al. 03]</a>.</p>
<p>The actin networks we will study hereafter, being in the condition where a linear behavior is expected, we will thus use the viscoelastic theory to interpret the
observed relation stress/strain, in order to determine the mechanical properties
of the formed actin gels.</p>

<div class="section" id="optical-tweezer">
<span id="id77"></span><h2>Optical tweezer<a class="headerlink" href="#optical-tweezer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Optical tweezers, or optical traps, are a technique that allows to trap objects
near the focal plane of a microscope, at the focal point of a high-power laser.
It is a versatile technique that allows to trap both fabricated objects and
parts of living cells. Optical traps typically allow to apply forces up to a few tenth of
pico Newton.</p>
<p>In order to understand that light can trap an object, it is instructive to keep in mind
that, despite having no mass, photons carry momentum and that, as for any massive
object, changing the trajectory requires a force.  According to Newton&#8217;s third
law, when applying a force via a photon on an object, the object will in turn
exert the opposite force on the photon, thus changing its trajectory. If a photon changes its trajectory in a material, the material has to apply a
force on it(<a href="#setup">Figure  431</a>), meaning that the photon also applies a force on the
material. In particular, the higher the refractive index of a material, the
more light beams are deviated, and hence the more photons apply forces on
material.</p>
<p>More specifically, it can be shown that objects with a higher refractive
index than the surrounding medium, are attracted towards higher light intensities
(<a href="#setup">Figure  431</a>).  In particular, laser beams with a Gaussian intensity
profile, will lead to the object being attracted towards their center.</p>
<p>In addition to the lateral trapping, the laser focus leads to
another intensity gradient along the direction of beam propagation, the intensity being at its maximum at the laser waist.</p>
<p>So, a laser coupled into a microscope objective acts as a three dimensional
potential that traps particles, similar to a tweezer. Usually the trapping in
a parallel to the laser direction, is only about half as strong if compared to the trapping in the
lateral direction.</p>
<div class="figure" id="setup">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/ot1.png"><img alt="schematic of setup plus one" src="../_images/ot1.png" style="width: 70%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 431: Light deflected by a transparent bead changes the light momentum, so the
light is exerting a force on the bead, which will be attracted towards
the highest intensity.  For a focused laser beam, the bead will be attracted
near the laser focus.</p>
</div>
<p>Among the qualities of optical traps, one is that in principle, multiple traps can be
obtained. A simple method to generate two traps is to split the incoming light
into two orthogonally polarized independent beams.  Instead of sharing the
laser power between the different traps by using polarisation, one can use what
is known as multiplexing by time sharing. This is achieved by rapidly switching the laser
between different positions at a much faster speed than the diffusion of the particles. By using this method,
it is possible to virtually achieve multiple traps on the same
sample.</p>
<p>In this work, we use a multiplexed system, where the rapid switching is achieved, by means of Accousto Optic Deflectors
(aka AODs).  An AOD consists of a crystal in which a high frequency
sound-wave propagates perpendicular to the incoming laser beam. This sound-wave generates local changes in the
refractive index of the material, which acts as a diffraction grating. In
the right conditions, a laser passing through the crystal will
be deflected by this grating under the Bragg angle.</p>
<p>In practice, rapidly controlling the frequency and amplitude of the sound-wave
in the crystal, allow direct adjustment of laser deflection and hence the
trap position. Not only does the use of AODs offer the advantage of controlling
the number and position of multiple traps, but also the individual power allocated to each trap, hence their stiffness.

<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/setup-plus-1.png"><img alt="schematic of setup plus one" src="../_images/setup-plus-1.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 432: A schematic of  setup used. The following elements can be distinguished. An
1064nm laser is used for trapping. It first passes through two AODs that
move the position of the trap in the X  and Y direction.  The first couple
of lenses (L1,L2) between AODs assures that AODs are in conjugated planes.
The second pair of lenses (L3,L4) image the AODs plane in the back-focal plane
of the first objective.
Thus, a change of angle of the light beam induced by the AOD,
results in a  change of the trap position.  The trapping light
is collected by a second objective, and illuminates a quadrant photodiode
(QPD) conjugated to the back focal plane of the collecting objective. By
construction, QPD and AODs should be conjugated, so the deviation of the light
beam induced by one of the AODs is not supposed to induce any change of
the laser spot position on the QPD. Additional dichroic mirrors allow to
use bright field and epifluorescence simultaneously with&nbsp;the optical
tweezer.</p>
</div>
<p>A schematic of the optical setup used to trap beads in the focal
plane on the microscope, can be found in <a href=".html#ots">figure </a><tt class="xref num docutils literal"><span class="pre">figure</span> <span class="pre">#ots</span></tt>. The scheme also
contains the detection part of the setup used to measure the force
exerted on each bead, technique which is explained in the following part.</p>
<div class="section" id="determination-of-trapping-forces-and-bead-displacement">
<h3>Determination of trapping forces and bead displacement<a class="headerlink" href="#determination-of-trapping-forces-and-bead-displacement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In addition to allowing the objects to be held in place, the use of a QDP
(Quadrant Photo Diode, a precise position detector) with optical traps, has the
advantage to acquire the high frequency quantitative measurements of the
displacement and force exerted on an object.  Indeed, when the trapped particle
is not in the trap center, the laser applies a force on the object.
Reciprocally, the object applies the opposite force on the light beam, thus
deflecting it.  With a proper use of optics and lenses correctly placed on the
Fourier plane of the sample, it is hence possible to translate this orientation
change of the light  beam into a displacement of a light spot, onto a photo
detector with high sensitivity to applied forces.</p>
<p>Through a careful calibration of the trap, which gives the force/displacement
relationship, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#jahnel2011" id="id78">[Jahnel et al. 11]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#vermeulen2006" id="id79">[Vermeulen et al. 06]</a>, one can then also
recover the sample displacement inside the optical trap.</p>
<p>Using an optical tweezer, not only aiming at holding a particle in position, but also at getting a
quantitative measurement of its displacement and the exerted force, requires to
calibrated each probe particle. Polystyrene beads are common artificial probes,
used to achieve such a goal.</p>
<p>The use of polystyrene beads has multiple advantages. First, one
can obtain mono-dispersed beads, leading to reproducible and predictable trap
stiffness. Secondly, theory can predict the shape of
the potential felt by such a bead in a Gaussian beam <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#nieminen2007" id="id80">[Nieminen et al. 07]</a>.</p>
<p>The third advantage is that beads can be fictionalized, allowing specific
interaction to be controlled, both <cite>in vitro</cite> and <cite>in vivo</cite>. Of course, the
calibration is essential for the correct measurement of the different systems mechanical property
, and the choice of the bead diameter has an impact both on
the biological side and in the measurement physics.</p>
