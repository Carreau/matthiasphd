<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cells are the basic component of living organism, understanding their
individual behavior and the way they function is a key step into understanding
how they interact with their environment and other organism. One of the key
component to most of organism is Actin, a protein which is highly conserved
across the species and play a important role in cell mechanics, from cell
migration to cell differentiation and division. It plays also a non negligible
in most mechanical properties of the cell and how it interacts with its
environment. In particular actin is the main component of the actin cortex :
the part of the cell cytoskeleton below the plasma membrane mostly responsible
for cell mechanical properties. The properties of this actin cortex is drive by
the mechanics of the properties of its main component : a dynamic actin
network. Understanding this actin network is hence a key piece to learn how
the actin cortex behave.</p>
<p>The properties of an actin network highly depend on it&#8217;s structure. The
structure itself depends on many parameters that influence how the network is
formed. Network structure and formation can be not only influence by its
physical and chemical environments but also by the variation of this
parameters with time and space.</p>
<p>Cells are complex systems that adapt their shape, mechanical properties and
biochemical conditions permanently. The spacial repartition of theses
properties is also variable as the cell regulate the concentration of proteins
all across its body. To well study the effect of each components independently,
it is crucial to study actin network in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Biomimetic systems allow to respond to most of these concern, they provide a
well controlled environment where biochemical condition can be well controlled
both in space and time. Theses systems keep their biological relevance, as they
can mimic <em>in vivo</em> phenomenon. Biomimetic systems are also well adapted to the
tools available and the approach from a physics point of view. The optical trap
will allow us to study local mechanical properties of actin  network  with a
high time resolution which could allow to get insight into the variation of
theses properties as a function of time.</p>
<p>During my PhD, my work has mainly be to study the mechanics of branched actin
network polymerizing on optically trapped polystyrene beads. Such network was
studied before <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#kawska2012" id="id8">[Kawska, Carvalho, Manzi,  et al.  2012]</a>  but have suspected to be highly inhomogeneous,
the use of optical trap allowed to probe mechanics of part of the network
unaccessible before.</p>

<p>Cells are the smallest living component which are present from unicellular
plants to multicellular animals. Thus, cells should cover a huge range of
behavior going from extremely specific on multicellular organism, to all the
function that are needed to survive and reproduce for bacterial colony.
Multicellular organism will grow specialized cell from neurone to osteoblast
going through germinal or muscle cells. In the other hand, unicellular
organisms are made of cell that are responsible for all the function of the
organism, from motility to reproduction, passing through absorption of
nutriment to replication of the cell.</p>
<p>Cell are hence able to adapt to their environment as a function of time, and
also have function and behavior that depends on time, and a small change of
timing and/or biochemical conditions can highly injure the development of an
organism <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#lenart2005" id="id10">[Lenart, Bacher, Daigle,  et al.  2005]</a>, it has also been observe that the mechanical
properties of substrate can govern the differentiation of cell

<p>Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotype, the cells
all have a common structure. They are constituted by a membrane which is
responsible form separating the cytoplasm from the outside of the cell. The
cytoplasm contains organelles, genetic material, and number of proteins that
the cell use to accomplish its functions. Cells are of course not completely
isolated, and have numbers of mechanism to exchange and communicate with the
outside. Communication with the outside are either chemical or mechanics.  To
sens their mechanical environment, cell use adhesion complexes to attach to the
medium, and integrins as trans-membrane protein will transfer the force to the
cell cytoskeleton situated inside the cell.</p>

<h3>The Cell Cytoskeleton<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cell-cytoskeleton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which give
it shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that possesses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how a organism move. As feet, fins and
wigs are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal does more
preferably prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton is will tell you many
things a bout a cell.</p>
<p>In the other hand, unlike (exo)-Skeleton of animals which is ridged and
unchanging, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keep
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cell
move. That&#8217;s through this dynamics that the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As mammals skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cell cytoskeleton is responsible to not only
transmit the force the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses force.
Thats through its cytoskeleton that a cell can be connected to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.</p>

<p>The cytoskeleton is mainly composed of three type of filaments.  The
microtubules, intermediate filament and actin filament, also known as
microfilament.</p>
<div class="section" id="microtubules">
<h4>Microtubules<a class="headerlink" href="#microtubules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Microtubules are the wider with a diameter of 20nm and [un article où on voit le diameter] the stiffer of the three kinds of filament with a persistence
length in the order of millimeter, which is much longer than the size of the
usual cell. Microtubules are extensively studied [cite some reviews ...].
Microtubules form polar (oriented) filament that can be walked on by molecular
motors that can be decomposed in two families – kinesins  and dyneins –
depending on the end toward which the motor preferably walk. Microtubules are
mostly known for their action during the cells mitosis where they will form
majority of the mitotic spindle that drive the segregation of the chromosomes
in two groups, each group ending in one of the daughter cells.</p>
<p>We will not be interested directly into the effect and behavior of microtubules
in this manuscript.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intermediate-filaments">
<h4>Intermediate filaments<a class="headerlink" href="#intermediate-filaments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Intermediate filaments are of medium diameter in the order of around 10nm, in
between actin and microtubules filament, hence their name.  Unlike microtubules
and actin filament, intermediate filaments are composed by several sub-families
of proteins and are non-polar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actin">
<h4>Actin<a class="headerlink" href="#actin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Actin, is the third component of the cytoskeleton, the one we will focus most
of our effort. Actin can forms actin filament, the thinest of the three kind
that form the cytoskeleton. Actin is produced in the cell as a globular protein
of ~40 kDa that once associated with ATP or ADP polymerise into helicoidal
filament with a diameter between 7 and 9nm. The formed actin filament are
polar, which both extremity respectively called the plus (<cite>+</cite>) or
barbed end, and the minus (<cite>-</cite>) or pointed end. The polarity of the actin
filament is of importance as this give rise to a proved direction for most
processes that can happen on the filament.</p>
<p>The actin protein is highly conserved across species, and is know to directly
interact with hundreds of proteins <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#dosremedios2003" id="id14">[dRemedios, Chhabra, Kekic,  et al.  2003]</a>. As hint before it can in particular bind to ATP, that can hydrolyse into,</p>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-of-actin-polymerisation">
<h5>Dynamic of actin polymerisation<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-of-actin-polymerisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The assembly mechanism that allow to go from singles monomers of actin (also
refer to as G-actin in solution) to actin filament (also refer as F-actin)
need to be well understood to explain the different structure of network actin
filament can give once put in presence of other proteins.</p>
<p>The polymerisation of ATP/ADP actin monomer to form an actin filament need to go
through the step of forming a actin proto-filament which is constituted of at
least 3 actin monomers. This will most of the time be the kinetically limiting
step. Once proto-filaments are present in solution, single monomers can be
freely added or removed on both end of the filament.</p>
<p>We now need to distinguish between the dynamic of adding or removing on both
ends of the filament. Indeed it has been show that the association and
dissociation rate are differing between the pointed (-) and barbed (+) end.
More particularly, the association rate at the barbed rate is higher that on
the pointed end, and same goes for the dissociation rate which has a bigger
constant on the minus end of actin filament. This lead to in imbalance of actin
(de)-polymerisation on both ends, which leads to actin filament preferably
growing on the barbed end and preferably shrinking from the pointed end.</p>
<p>The equations that drive the polymerisation can thus be written as follow</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{dC_b}{dt} &amp;= k_{+,b}.[monomers] - k_{-,b} \\
\frac{dC_p}{dt} &amp;= k_{+,p}.[monomers] - k_{-,p} \\\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Where <cite>b</cite> and <cite>p</cite> designate respectively the barbed and pointed end, and
<span class="math">\(k_+\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k_-\)</span> are the polymerisation and depolymerisation rate.
The concentration in barbed and pointed end denoted by <span class="math">\(C_\_\)</span>. By
assuming that the number of pointed end is equal to the number of barbed end,
one can derive the steady state which give rise to the critical monomer
concentration below which a actin filament cannot grow: <span class="math">\([monomers]_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rate constant of elongation of actin have been determined to also depend of
whether the monomer was bound to ADP or ATP <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pollard1986" id="id15">[Pollard,  1986]</a>. We should now
consider the fact that ATP-bound actin will hydrolyse to ADP-Pi then release
the inorganic phosphate, and thus with a rate that also depend on whether the
monomer is part of a filament or in solution.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the in stationary state the length of each actin
filaments statistically constant because the speed of polymerisation on the
barbed end is compensated by the depolymerisation on the pointed end. The
filament is hence in a threadmilling state. If we follow a single actin monomer
bound to an ATP molecule, it will be incorporated at the <cite>+</cite> end of the
filament and progressively move toward the minus end, eventually hydrolysing
it&#8217;s ATP into ADP before detecting from the filament on the pointed end.</p>
