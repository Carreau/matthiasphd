<p>Mouse oocyte are big spherical cell with a diameter in the order of 80 µm.  It
ha been shown that the spindle positioning during meiotic division of oocyte is
dependant of an actin meshwork present in the cell <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#schuh2008" id="id1">[Schuh, Ellenberg,  2008]</a>.  This
actin meshwork is regulated by endogenous vesicle which dynamic is myosin-Vb
dependant <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#holubcova2013" id="id2">[Holubcova, Howard, Schuh,  2013]</a>. In a collaboration with Marie-Hélène Verhlac
and Maria Almonacid in Collège de France, we designed a way to  measure
cytoplasmic activity in mouse oocyte.</p>

nucleus is positioned at the center of the oocyte during Meiosis I by the
help of the actin network. The positioning is a crucial factor for the
normal division of the oocyte.  Oocytes are a good reference system  by
their symmetry and their sufficient size that help measuring spatial
variation of mechanical properties.  Image Credit to Maria Almonacid from

<p>As oocyte meshwork in oocyte is controlled by the activity of formins than
drive actin polymerisation and Myosins Vb that controlled the dynamism of the
vesicle in the meshwork, we decided to develop the analysis in 3 type oocytes.
Wild types oocyte, oocyte preleved on Formin 2 invalidated female that lack the
actin meshwork and oocytes injected  with the dominant-negative tail of Myosin
Vb (<a class="pageref" href="#fig3oo">Fig  2</a>)</p>

<h2>Measure of activity<a class="headerlink" href="#measure-of-activity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The diffusion of actin positive vesicle ta can be seen during oocyte meiosis is
less important in Formin -/- and MyosinVb-tails oocytes than in Wild type.
While particle tracking with the vesicle present in oocyte is possible, it is a
complex process especially with the diffusion of vesicle outside the focal
plane of the microscope. In order to measure the activity we thus decided to
investigate the variations of the bright field images in mouse oocyte.</p>
<p>We can compute the difference between  region of interest (ROI) of images as a
function of time to see how fast the bright field image changes. We can compare
the result for wild type (<a class="pageref" href="#decay-wt">Fig  3</a>), Formin Knockout (<a class="pageref" href="#decay-fmn2">Fig  5</a>) and MyosinVb dominant negative tail (<a class="pageref" href="#decay-myo">Fig  4</a>).</p>

well at the difference between t=1m, t=174m and initial image. Blue
indicate that the later image is brighter that the original one and red
indicate that it is darker.  For wild type oocyte, we can see that the
scale difference between images is similar for a <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> of 1
minute and 174 minute. Region show is the same as indicated in <a class="pageref" href="#fig3oo">figure  2</a>.</p>

is much stronger after several hours (174min) than after a minute, unlike

<p>A quantitative measurement of the difference of the images is the
autocorrelation of these thought time. The correlation of two images <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> of same dimension is defined as :</p>
<div class="math">
\[r_{xy}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{(n-1) s_x s_y}\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y_i\)</span> are luminosity values of each of the
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> pixels in <span class="math">\(\bar{x},\bar{y}\)</span> correspond to average values over
the images, <span class="math">\(s_x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(s_y\)</span> are the standard deviation of the
luminosity values.</p>
<p>We can compare the decrease of correlation with time depending on the type of
oocyte. In order to extract a single value that represent the activity, we can phenomenologically fit the correlation as a function of time with a decaying exponential with an offset :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-edecay">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[r(t) = (1-off).e^{(-t/\tau)}+off\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is time, and <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is the characteristic time of
correlation decay. The offset  <span class="math">\(off\)</span> represent the value of the
correlation at infinite time to take into account artifact in the chosen region
of interest, and defect in the image that will not decorrelate through time.</p>
<p>Example of the result of calculating the correlation through time, and fitting
a decaying exponential can be seen on <a class="pageref" href="#fig-exp-decay">figure  6</a></p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-exp-decay">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/corrtime.png"><img alt="../_images/corrtime.png" src="../_images/corrtime.png" style="width: 65%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 6: Decreasing of autocorrelation off images  (solid line ) through time, with
exponential decay fit (dotted lines) as in <a href="#equation-edecay">(1)</a>, and value of the
characteristic decay time <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> as legend. We can see that the
correlation of the images decrease much faster in wild type oocyte (red
curves, <span class="math">\(\tau \sim minute\)</span>) than in Formin knockout (blue lines
<span class="math">\(\tau &gt; hour\)</span>) that lack the actin meshwork, or than the myosin Vb
tails dominant negative (green <span class="math">\(\tau &gt; hour\)</span>)</p>
</div>
<p>We see the value of the characteristic time increases with when we disrupt the
actin network or the  source of its dynamism by inactivating Myosin Vb. We can
then use the inverse of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> as an indicator of activity.</p>
<p>Once we have define the activity of a region of the cytoplasm of the cell, we
can repeat the measurement on different area of the cytoplasm, and we can
reproduce a map of the activity in the cell as a function of the position (
<a class="pageref" href="#fig-activity-map">Fig  7</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-activity-map">

analysed bright field image. Example for an of a wild type oocyte. Scale
bar is 20 µm. We can see that the activity is near the nucleus is lower
(blue) than in the middle of the cytoplasm.</p>
</div>
<p>The measure of the correlation characteristic decay time can also be done on a
time sliding widows. This allows for the determination of activity of a
particular area of the cytoplasm with time.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this part we developed a methods that allow to determine the cytoplasmic
activity. Tis methods also allow to determine the variation of this cytoplasmic
activity with space and time. This methods is the study of oocyte as it allows
to probe timescale from the second to the hour which is in the order of the
relevant timescale for oocyte maturation of a few hours. It is also
complementary to techniques like micro rheology that have difficulties probing
timescale beyond tens of seconds due to thermal drift and cell movements, but
reach much shorter timescale.</p>
<p>The use of this technique is currently under investigation at Collège de France
by Marie-Hélène Verhlac and Maria Almonacid. It is used to measure the activity
of actin network in oocyte and determine their effect on the meiosis of mouse
oocyte.</p>
