<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Mouse oocyte are big spherical cells with a diameter of about 80 µm.  Previous work has shown
that the spindle positioning during meiotic cell division in oocytes depends
on an actin meshwork that is present in the cell&#8217;s cytoplasm <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#schuh2008" id="id1">[Schuh, Ellenberg,  2008]</a>.  This
actin meshwork is regulated by formin that is localized to endogenous vesicles.
Additionally, these vesicles recruit the myosin-Vb motor protein, that are know do drive the active movement
of the vesicles in the cytoplasm <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#holubcova2013" id="id2">[Holubcova, Howard, Schuh,  2013]</a>. In a collaborative project with the group of Marie-Hélène Verlhac
and her Postdoc Maria Almonacid at the Collège de France, I designed a way to measure
cytoplasmic activity in mouse oocyte.</p>
<p>In <a class="pageref" href="#oocytewt">figure  1</a> a typical mouse
oocyte is presented where the nucleus can be seen to be positioned at the center of the cell.
Current questions in this system relate to the mechanical processes during meiosis such as the chromosome migration,
the asymmetric cell division and the positioning of organelles by the dynamic remodelling of the actin network.
While our team did active and passive microrheology measurements on the timescales or 10 seconds, I developed a
method that is suitable for longer timescales in the order of minutes, that are more relevant for the process of meiosis.</p>

The cell diameter is about 80µm. The nucleus is positioned at the center of
the oocyte during meiosis I by the help of the actin network. The
positioning is a crucial factor for the normal division of the oocyte. The
oocytes are a good reference system as they provide a clean spherical
symmetry and due to their size give a good spatial differences between the
cortex and the cytosol which helps in measuring spatial variations of
mechanical properties and vesicle movement.  Image Credit to Maria

<h2>Oocytes<a class="headerlink" href="#oocytes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The cytosolic actin meshwork in oocytes is controlled by the activity of formins (Fmn2) that
nucleate actin polymerisation and by the activity of the vesicle bound molecular motor protein myosin Vb that
controls the dynamic movement of the
vesicles in the actin meshwork. Hence it is of interest to study oocytes that have formin and myosin Vb deficits.
In particular, we focused on three types: 1) Wild types oocyte, 2) oocytes prepared from Formin 2 invalidated female
(Fnm2-/-) that lack the
actin meshwork and 3) oocytes injected with the RNA coding for the dominant-negative tail of Myosin
Vb (<a class="pageref" href="#fig3oo">Fig  2</a>), thus replacing the active myosin Vb on the vesicles.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig3oo">

theses oocytes lack the actin meshwork. MyosinVb Tails) Oocyte injected
with the RNA coding for Myosin Vb dominant negative tails. These cells have a less active vesicle
population. The white square gives an example of the region that is used for the analysis presented in this chapter.</p>

<div class="section" id="measure-of-activity">
<h2>Measure of activity<a class="headerlink" href="#measure-of-activity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The diffusive like motion of actin positive vesicles that can be observed during oocyte meiosis is
reduced in Fmn2-/- and MyosinVb-tails oocytes when compared to the wild type.
While the use of particle tracking algorithms to measure vesicle motion in oocyte is possible, it remains a
complex process especially as the vesicles may move outside the focal
plane of the microscope. As a simple approach to measure the vesicle activity we decided to
investigate the temporal variations of the bright field images in mouse oocytes.</p>
<p>We can compute the time dependent difference between predefined region of interest (ROI) in an image
series to see how fast the bright field images change. Then we compare
the result between wild type, Formin Knockout and MyosinVb dominant negative tails (<a class="pageref" href="#decay-all">Fig  3</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="decay-all">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/decay-all.png"><img alt="../_images/decay-all.png" src="../_images/decay-all.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Bright field images of 3 types of mouse oocyte : Wild type in first column,
Formin knockout in second, Myosin Tail dominant negative in the third. Row 1
to 3 represent the region of interest of <a class="pageref" href="#fig3oo">figure  2</a> (20 µm side)
for each kind of oocyte. Row 1 show region of interest at t=0s, row 2 at
t=1min and row 3 at t=10min. The color-coded difference between images at
t=0s and 60s are shown on row 4, and between t=0s and 10min row 6. Blue
indicate that the later image is brighter that the original one and red
indicate that it is darker. For wild type oocyte, the difference of images
reaches rapidly its maximum value (Image J and M similar), Whereas for
Fmn2-/- and MyoVb the difference between images separated by 60 seconds
(K,L) is much smaller than after 10 minutes (N,O) which can be seen as the
(K) is whiter than (N) and (L) is whiter than (O). The change in cytoplasm
is thus much faster in WT oocyte (<span class="math">\(&lt; min\)</span>) while it takes
significantly longer in Fmn2-/- and MyosinVb oocytes.</p>
</div>
<p>To get a quantitative measurement of the speed at which the difference of the
images changes, we can compute the autocorrelation of bright field images
thought time. The correlation of two images <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> of same
dimension is defined as :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa501">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[r_{AB}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (A_i-\bar{A})(B_i-\bar{B})}{(n-1) s_A s_B}\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(A_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B_i\)</span> are luminosity values of each of the
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> pixels of the images,  <span class="math">\(\bar{A},\bar{B}\)</span> correspond to average
luminosity values over the images, <span class="math">\(s_A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(s_B\)</span> are the standard
deviations of the luminosity values. The correlation will give us a single
value that characterise the similarity of the images. A correlation of
<span class="math">\(1\)</span> mean the images are identical, a correlation of <cite>0</cite>, mean that the
images have nothing in common, a negative value of correlation mean that the
second image is globally dark where the first one is bright and bright when the
first one is dark. We can thus obtain a measurement of similarity of images
over time, that should start at <span class="math">\(1\)</span> for <span class="math">\(\Delta t=0s\)</span> between
images. We expect it to decrease until it eventually reaches zero.</p>
<p>We can compare the decrease of correlation over time depending on the type of
oocyte. In order to extract a single value that represents the activity, we can
phenomenologically fit the correlation as a decaying exponential with an offset
:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-edecay">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[r(t) = (1-off).e^{(-t/\tau)}+off\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is time, and <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is a characteristic time
representing the correlation decay. The offset  <span class="math">\(off\)</span> represent the value
of the correlation at infinite time to take into account artifacts in the chosen
region of interest, and defects in the image that will not decorrelate over
time.</p>
<p><a class="pageref" href="#fig-exp-decay">Figure  4</a> gives typical examples of the result of the
measured autocorrelation over time, and a single exponential decay fit.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-exp-decay">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/corrtime.png"><img alt="../_images/corrtime.png" src="../_images/corrtime.png" style="width: 65%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 4: Decreasing autocorrelation of images intensity (solid line) over time, with
exponential decay fit (dotted lines) as in <a href="#equation-edecay">(2)</a>. The characteristic decay time of the fit
<span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> in the legend. We can see in the plot that the
correlation of the images decrease much faster in wild type oocyte (red
curves, <span class="math">\(\tau \sim minute\)</span>) in compared to Fmn2-/- (blue lines
<span class="math">\(\tau &gt; hour\)</span>) that lack the actin meshwork, or to dominant negative myosin Vb
tails (green <span class="math">\(\tau &gt; hour\)</span>). While the fit quality is not impressively good, the
overall change in the timescales is well captured.</p>
</div>
<p>The results show that the values of the characteristic time increases when
the actin network is disrupted in Fnm2-/- cells or when the source of its dynamics is removed by inactivating
Myosin Vb. We can then use the inverse of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> as an indicator of
activity.</p>
<p>Once we have define the activity of a region of the cytoplasm of the cell, we
can repeat the measurement on different areas of the cytoplasm. This allows to
reproduce a map of the activity in the cell as a function of the position (<a class="pageref" href="#fig-activity-map">Fig  5</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-activity-map">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/CellAct-WT.png"><img alt="../_images/CellAct-WT.png" src="../_images/CellAct-WT.png" style="width: 95%;" /></a>

analysed bright field image. Scale
bar is 20 µm. We can see that the activity is near the nucleus is lower
(blue) than in the middle of the cytoplasm.</p>
</div>
<p>The measure of the correlation characteristic decay time can also be done on a
time sliding widows. This allows for the determination of activity of a
particular area of the cytoplasm with time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this part we developed a method that allows to determine the cytoplasmic
activity in oocytes by a noninvasive image analysis. This method also allows
to measure the spatial and temporal variation of this cytoplasmic
activity. A further advantage of this method is its flexibility regarding the timescales
that are probed reaching from the second up to hours, noting that this is similar to the
timescales relevant for oocyte maturation. Measurements on timescales of minutes are also
complementary to techniques like active optical tweezer based micro-rheology that have difficulties in probing
timescale beyond tens of seconds due to thermal drift and cell movement, but
reach on the other hand much shorter timescales of below ms.</p>
<p>The proposed technique is currently actively applied by Marie-Hélène Verlhac and Maria Almonacid at the Collège de France.
It is used to measure the activity
of actin networks in oocyte and determine their effect on the meiosis of mouse
oocyte and the organelle positioning.</p>
