<p>Cells are the smallest living component which are present from unicellular
plants to multicellular animals. Thus, cells should cover a huge range of
behavior going from extremely specific on multicellular organism, to all the
function that are needed to survive and reproduce for bacterial colony.
Multicellular organism will grow specialized cell from neurone to osteoblast
going through germinal or muscle cells. In the other hand, unicellular
organisms are made of cell that are responsible for all the function of the
organism, from motility to reproduction, passing through absorption of
nutriment to replication of the cell.</p>
<p>Cell are hence able to adapt to their environment as a function of time, and
also have function and behavior that depends on time, and a small change of
timing and/or biochemical conditions can highly injure the development of an
organism <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#lenart2005" id="id2">[Lenart, Bacher, Daigle,  et al.  2005]</a>, it has also been observe that the mechanical
properties of substrate can govern the differentiation of cell
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#engler2006" id="id3">[Engler, Sen, Sweeney, Discher,  2006]</a> .</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even with all theses different behavior and phenotype, the cells
all have a common structure. They are constituted by a membrane which is
responsible form separating the cytoplasm from the outside of the cell. The
cytoplasm contains organelles, genetic material, and number of proteins that
the cell use to accomplish its functions. Cells are of course not completely
isolated, and have numbers of mechanism to exchange and communicate with the
outside. Communication with the outside are either chemical or mechanics.  To
sens their mechanical environment, cell use adhesion complexes to attach to the
medium, and integrins as trans-membrane protein will transfer the force to the
cell cytoskeleton situated inside the cell.</p>

<h2>The Cell Cytoskeleton<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cell-cytoskeleton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The cytoskeleton, literally skeleton of the cell, is the structure which give
it shape to a cell.  As for other multicellular animals that possesses
skeleton, its shape is often a hint on how a organism move. As feet, fins and
wigs are characteristics that will tell you whether a animal does more
preferably prefer land, see or air, the cytoskeleton is will tell you many
things a bout a cell.</p>
<p>In the other hand, unlike (exo)-Skeleton of animals which is ridged and
unchanging, the cytoskeleton of cell is a  highly dynamic structure that keep
remodeling itself on a short time scale compared to the speed at which a cell
move. That&#8217;s through this dynamics that the cytoskeleton can achieve its
functions.  As mammals skeletons are necessary to transmit force from one part
of the body to another, the cell cytoskeleton is responsible to not only
transmit the force the cell is exerting, but also to generate theses force.
Thats through its cytoskeleton that a cell can be connected to its environment,
both mechanically and biochemically.</p>

<p>The cytoskeleton is mainly composed of three type of filaments.  The
microtubules, intermediate filament and actin filament, also known as
microfilament.</p>
<div class="section" id="microtubules">
<h3>Microtubules<a class="headerlink" href="#microtubules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Microtubules are the wider with a diameter of 20nm and [un article où on voit le diameter] the stiffer of the three kinds of filament with a persistence
length in the order of millimeter, which is much longer than the size of the
usual cell. Microtubules are extensively studied [cite some reviews ...].
Microtubules form polar (oriented) filament that can be walked on by molecular
motors that can be decomposed in two families – kinesins  and dyneins –
depending on the end toward which the motor preferably walk. Microtubules are
mostly known for their action during the cells mitosis where they will form
majority of the mitotic spindle that drive the segregation of the chromosomes
in two groups, each group ending in one of the daughter cells.</p>
<p>We will not be interested directly into the effect and behavior of microtubules
in this manuscript.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intermediate-filaments">
<h3>Intermediate filaments<a class="headerlink" href="#intermediate-filaments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Intermediate filaments are of medium diameter in the order of around 10nm, in
between actin and microtubules filament, hence their name.  Unlike microtubules
and actin filament, intermediate filaments are composed by several sub-families
of proteins and are non-polar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actin">
<h3>Actin<a class="headerlink" href="#actin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Actin, is the third component of the cytoskeleton, the one we will focus most
of our effort. Actin can forms actin filament, the thinest of the three kind
that form the cytoskeleton. Actin is produced in the cell as a globular protein
of ~40 kDa that once associated with ATP or ADP polymerise into helicoidal
filament with a diameter between 7 and 9nm. The formed actin filament are
polar, which both extremity respectively called the plus (<cite>+</cite>) or
barbed end, and the minus (<cite>-</cite>) or pointed end. The polarity of the actin
filament is of importance as this give rise to a proved direction for most
processes that can happen on the filament.</p>
<p>The actin protein is highly conserved across species, and is know to directly
interact with hundreds of proteins <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#dosremedios2003" id="id6">[dRemedios, Chhabra, Kekic,  et al.  2003]</a>. As hint before it
can in particular bind to ATP, that can hydrolyse into, ADP</p>
<p>Single undecorated filament will behave at the scale of the cell as
semi-flexible polymer with a persistence length in the order of 10 µm. When the
assemble into different structure and network, or associate with other proteins
and molecule the resulting mechanical and dynamic properties can be highly changed.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-of-actin-polymerisation">
<h4>Dynamic of actin polymerisation<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-of-actin-polymerisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The assembly mechanism that allow to go from singles monomers of actin (also
refer to as G-actin in solution) to actin filament (also refer as F-actin)
need to be well understood to explain the different structure of network actin
filament can give once put in presence of other proteins.</p>
<p>The polymerisation of ATP/ADP actin monomer to form an actin filament need to go
through the step of forming a actin proto-filament which is constituted of at
least 3 actin monomers. This will most of the time be the kinetically limiting
step. Once proto-filaments are present in solution, single monomers can be
freely added or removed on both end of the filament.</p>
<p>We now need to distinguish between the dynamic of adding or removing on both
ends of the filament. Indeed it has been show that the association and
dissociation rate are differing between the pointed (-) and barbed (+) end.
More particularly, the association rate at the barbed rate is higher that on
the pointed end, and same goes for the dissociation rate which has a bigger
constant on the minus end of actin filament. This lead to in imbalance of actin
(de)-polymerisation on both ends, which leads to actin filament preferably
growing on the barbed end and preferably shrinking from the pointed end.</p>
<p>The equations that drive the polymerisation can thus be written as follow</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{dC_b}{dt} &amp;= k_{+,b}.[monomers] - k_{-,b} \\
\frac{dC_p}{dt} &amp;= k_{+,p}.[monomers] - k_{-,p} \\\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Where <cite>b</cite> and <cite>p</cite> designate respectively the barbed and pointed end, and
<span class="math">\(k_+\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k_-\)</span> are the polymerisation and depolymerisation rate.
The concentration in barbed and pointed end denoted by <span class="math">\(C_\_\)</span>. By
assuming that the number of pointed end is equal to the number of barbed end,
one can derive the steady state which give rise to the critical monomer
concentration below which a actin filament cannot grow: <span class="math">\([monomers]_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rate constant of elongation of actin have been determined to also depend of
whether the monomer was bound to ADP or ATP <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#pollard1986" id="id7">[Pollard,  1986]</a>. We should now
consider the fact that ATP-bound actin will hydrolyse to ADP-Pi then release
the inorganic phosphate, and thus with a rate that also depend on whether the
monomer is part of a filament or in solution.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the in stationary state the length of each actin
filaments statistically constant because the speed of polymerisation on the
barbed end is compensated by the depolymerisation on the pointed end. The
filament is hence in a threadmilling state. If we follow a single actin monomer
bound to an ATP molecule, it will be incorporated at the <cite>+</cite> end of the
filament and progressively move toward the minus end, eventually hydrolysing
it&#8217;s ATP into ADP before detecting from the filament on the pointed end.</p>

<h4>Proteins influencing actin polymerisation<a class="headerlink" href="#proteins-influencing-actin-polymerisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Despite the already complex process that is actin polymerisation and the
numbers of parameter that we have already introduce, the formation of an actin
network is a even more complex process that involve many other components.
Especially, actin monomers and filament can interact with a high number of
proteins that will effect previously established dynamics.  We will present
some categories of such protein</p>
<div class="section" id="polymerase-and-polymerase-family">
<h5>Polymerase and polymerase family<a class="headerlink" href="#polymerase-and-polymerase-family" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The polymerase family as their name indicate will directly have effect on the
polymerisation of actin. In the right condition, polymerase will increase the
<span class="math">\(k_+\)</span> At one end of the actin filament for the same concentration of
actin monomers. This can lead to an average longer filament length.</p>
<p><cite>Formins</cite> Are one of those polymerase proteins that will increase the
polymerisation rate at the barbed end. It has the particularity of being
processing, meaning that it will stay bound to the barbed and while catalysing
the addition of new monomers. We will see that the processivity of formins also
permit the control of the localisation of actin polymerisation where formin
proteins are present, like the tip of filopodia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actin-depolymerisation-and-severing">
<h5>Actin depolymerisation and severing<a class="headerlink" href="#actin-depolymerisation-and-severing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Like polymerisation that can be enhanced by some proteins, depolymerisation can
also be speed up by divers proteins. ADF/Cofilin is such a family of protein
which is able to speedup the depolymerisation of actin either by increasing the
off rate at the pointed end, or by actively severing the filament in different
point, thus disassembling the formed network.</p>
<p>It should be noted that depolymerisation can not only be  enhanced at the
pointed end, indeed formin is also able to accelerate the detachment of actin
monomers at the barbed end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="capping-protein">
<h5>Capping Protein<a class="headerlink" href="#capping-protein" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If cell have possibility to increase of decrease polymerisation speed, they
also need to be able to regulate the by decreasing the polymerisation speed.
To achieve this, some proteins will bind to the growing end of actin filament and prevent the addition of monomers on the filament. Such a family of protein are called the <cite>capping protein</cite> family with <cite>Capping Protein</cite> being one particular example that will specifically bind to the barbed end of a growing filament and  prevent here from growing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crosslinkers">
<h5>Crosslinkers<a class="headerlink" href="#crosslinkers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>We have seen that some proteins were able to attach to actin filament, when
such a protein is able to attach to many filament at once, it can act as an
attachment point between the two filament, preventing them to move with respect
one to the other. Such proteins, are referred to as crosslinkers.</p>
<p>The amount of freedom in movement between the two filament is dependant of the
used crosslinker. For example , α-actinin will allow rotation of the two
filament at their anchoring point whereas crosslinker like fascine will prefer
a parallel conformation of the filament and favor the formation of actin
bundles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stabilising-actin-filaments">
<h5>Stabilising actin filaments<a class="headerlink" href="#stabilising-actin-filaments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As actin network a dynamics construct that are changing shape and properties
with time, it is convenient to be able to stabilize those network. Tropomyosins
are proteins capable to bind on the side of actin filament to stabilise them.</p>
<p>The use of phalloidin, a toxin extracted from fungus, is also common as by
binding between F-actin subunits on the filament, it prevent it from
depolymerising.  Though, it is known that stabilizing actin filaments with
phalloidin will increase they persistence length which can change the
mechanical properties of the formed actin network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="molecular-motor">
<h5>Molecular Motor<a class="headerlink" href="#molecular-motor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A particular kind of protein that can bind to cytoskeleton filament are
molecular motors. Molecular motors are proteins that will consume energy source
in the form of ATP, hydrolyse it to change conformation and produce forces.</p>
<p>Different motors exist for each kinds of filament. The  one that walk on
F-actin are part of the myosin family. Myosins head will bond on the side of
F-actin filament and the hydrolysis on ATP into ADP will produce a power stroke
that will make the myosin tail to move in the direction of the pointed. This
will make myosin waling preferably toward the barbed end of actin filament,
pulling anything being attached to its tail with it. The mechanism that allow
myosin to reliably walk toward the right end of the actin filament will depend
on the type of Myosins,  Myosins V for example will be processive and the
single dimers with two head will be able to effect several step in a row.
Whereas <cite>Myosin II</cite> is only able to effect one step before detaching from the
actin filament the processivity being statistically achieve by having  a high
number of myosin filament bundled together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="profilin">
<h5>Profilin<a class="headerlink" href="#profilin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Profiling is a protein that will bind to single monomers of actin in solution.
By doing so it will first prevent the association of monomers into dimers and
trimmers, thus preventing the nucleation of actin filament. It thus allow a
better control of localisation of actin filament both in vivo and in vitro in
the presence of actin seeds of actin nucleator.</p>
<p>The second effect will be to decrease the concentration of monomers in
solution, effectively decreasing the growing rate at the barbed end, and
increasing depolymerisation rate at the pointed end.</p>
<p>Describing the role on profiling alone on actin monomers and actin filament is
not sufficient to understand it&#8217;s role in cell, indeed profiling interact with
formin giving and unsuspected result. In presence of profilin the effect of
formin is exacerbated and the polymerisation (or depolymerisation) rate of
actin is even more increased. This can be explain by the fact that the addition
of actin monomers is a two step process where monomers will first attach to
formin before being added to the actin filament. The constant rate of
(at|de)ttachment is hight for the actin/profilin complex than with single actin
monomer.</p>
<p>We here start to understand why the complexity of a system increase quickly
with the number of protein involve, the presence of both formins and profilin
in a system will localise and increase actin polymerisation at the location of
formins as well as prevent the polymerisation in area where no formin is
present. This can for example happen between the leading edge of a cell where
formins are attached and where the actin depolymerise in th cytoplasm. The
increase polymerisation at the leading edge will also act toward the depletion
of actin monomers in the cytoplasm exaggerating even more the depolymerisation
rate at the far from the membrane. This leads to a higher turnover of actin
networks.</p>

<h2>Cell Organelle<a class="headerlink" href="#cell-organelle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beyond the membrane , cytoplasm and cytoskeleton, cell have a number of
structure that have different and specialised function. The position and
state of each of theses structure is of great importance in order for the
cell to achieve its function. Probably the most known of the organelles is
the cell nucleus of eukaryotes cells that contain the genetic material of the
cell. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic reticulum (also know as ER)
is the organelle that is responsible form translating RNA coming from to
nucleus in to functional proteins that will be delivered across the cell
after maturation through vesicles. Theses vesicles are transported across the
cell by dyneins and kinesins, molecular motors, that walks along microtubules
originating from the centrioles part of the centrosome. All of those process
consume energy as the form of ATP, generated from with the mitocondria spread
across the cytoplasm.</p>
