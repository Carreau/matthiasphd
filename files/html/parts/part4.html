<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have seen that in cells, the actin cytoskeleton is a key component to form
structures such as the actin cortex, used to transmit forces and bring to cells
their mechanical rigidity. In order to drive shape changes, cells regulate the
mechanical properties of the sub-micrometer thick actin cortex,
beneath the membrane <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#clark2013" id="id1">[Clark et al. 13]</a>. The actin cortex dynamics
drives cell shape changes <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#salbreux2012b" id="id2">[Salbreux et al. 12]</a> and the presence of the
molecular motor myosin II plays a fundamental role in the tension of the
acto-myosin cortex <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#tinevez2009" id="id3">[Tinevez et al. 09]</a>. The cortical tension can be measured on
cells and varies between 50 and 4000 pN/µm in accordance with both actin and myosin activity .</p>
<p>These changes of the cortical tension are also affected by cell-cell
adhesions <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#maitre2012" id="id4">[Maitre et al. 12]</a> whose major role played in cell sorting have already been proved.</p>
<p>Recently, such acto-myosin cortices have been reconstructed on cell-sized
liposomes <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#carvalho2013a" id="id5">[Carvalho et al. 13a]</a>, which showed that the attachment of the actin
cortex to the membrane plays a crucial role in the acto-myosin network behavior and contractility.</p>
<p>In the present study, I collaborated with Kévin Carvalho and Joël Lemière, to
further extend the previously developed system <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#carvalho2013a" id="id6">[Carvalho et al. 13a]</a>
aiming at monitoring the cortical tension changes in a biomimetic actin cortex formed
on liposomes. I mainly contributed to the analysis of the 3D data, acquired by using Spinning Disk Microscopy and , for the analysis developed for this purpose a
novel method to get a precise and unbiased measure of the geometrical
parameter.</p>
<p>It should be noticed that in a recent works, cell doublets were used to determine the role of cortical tension in cells <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#maitre2012" id="id7">[Maitre et al. 12]</a>. In the present case, we formed similar doublets from liposomes,
around which we polymerised an actin cortex <cite>in vitro</cite> (<a href="#fig1a">Fig  215</a>). The
shape changes of these liposome doublets allowed the time-dependent monitoring of
cortical tension in a non-invasive way.  In this project, we hence developed a
method for the precise acquisition of doublet deformation, in order to accurately determine
the tension increase induced by the injection of myosin motor on
the preformed actin cortex.</p>

<p>Liposomes were obtained by electro-formation (see <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#electroformation"><em>Material and methods</em></a>) from a mix of EPC and PEG-biotin lipids. The presence of
streptavidin in the working buffer allowed liposomes to naturally stick together
to form doublets after 15 minutes (<a href="#fig1a">Fig  215</a>).</p>

<h3>Formation of actin cortex on doublets<a class="headerlink" href="#formation-of-actin-cortex-on-doublets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The formation of the actin network on doublets was done in a similar way as recently described
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#carvalho2013a" id="id8">[Carvalho et al. 13a]</a>.  Briefly, actin filaments including
biotinylated monomers were stabilised by phalloidin and linked to PEG-Biotin
lipids (see <a class="reference internal" href="part2.html#m-et-m"><em>materials and methods</em></a>)  via streptavidin,
present in the solution (<a href="#fig1b">Fig  217</a>).  Besides linking the actin to the
membrane, it also cross-linked the filaments.  Such a network has already been
recently characterised <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#carvalho2013a" id="id9">[Carvalho et al. 13a]</a>.  Note that as the actin filaments
were only added after the formation of the doublets, the interface between the
two liposomes composing the doublets remained free of F-actin (<a href="#fig1c">Fig  218</a>, <a href="#fds"> 216</a>). As the added actin was fluorescent, the absence of actin
at the liposome interface could be checked by epifluorescence, as it appeared dark
compared to the rest of the doublet(<a href="#fig1c">Fig  218</a>).</p>

<p>The muscle Myosin II that formed <a class="reference internal" href="part1.html#myoii"><em>bipolars filaments</em></a> was carefully injected into

<p>The distance between the liposome centers decreased as the total angle <span class="math">\(\theta

the presence of myosin II (200 nM) we found  a value of <span class="math">\(\theta = 86 \pm 21
^{\circ}\)</span> (n=5). Measurements of the contact angle after myosin II injection were done before the cortex
ruptures as characterised in <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#carvalho2013a" id="id11">[Carvalho et al. 13a]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="relation-between-the-angles-and-tension">
<h3>Relation between the angles and tension<a class="headerlink" href="#relation-between-the-angles-and-tension" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each liposome has its respective tension <span class="math">\(\tau_1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\tau_2\)</span>.  In the absence
of the biomimetic acto-myosin cortex, these tensions only correspond to the
tension of the liposome membrane. The interface between the two liposomes is
formed by two lipid bilayers, and the inter-facial tension is composed of two contributions:
the tension of the lipid bilayer, noted <span class="math">\(\tau_i\)</span>, and the
adhesion energy per surface unit <span class="math">\(W\)</span> due to the biotin-streptavidin-biotin link
between the two lipid bilayers. The total tension at the interface can thus be
written <span class="math">\(\tau_t = \tau_i -W\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#maitre2012" id="id12">[Maitre et al. 12]</a>.</p>
<p>As the movement of the contact line during the contraction is slow (order of
µm/min) compared to the pressure equilibration across the doublet, we can consider
the contact line between the liposomes and the interface to be at equilibrium.
Hence, we can apply Young&#8217;s equation:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eqa401">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\begin{split}\sum_{k \in interfaces} \tau_k. \vec t_k  = \vec 0 \\
\tau_i \vec t_i + \tau_1 \vec t_1 + \tau_2 \vec t_2 + = \vec 0\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In which <span class="math">\(t_k\)</span> are the vectors tangent to the interface at the contact point, as described in <a href="#fig-yd">figure  221</a></p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-yd">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/yd.png"><img alt="../_images/yd.png" src="../_images/yd.png" style="width: 60%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 221: Equilibrium of the contact line. Each interface pulls on the line with a
force proportional to its tension. As the contact line is at equilibrium,
the sum of the forces compensate, thus ensuring  a relation between the tensions and the contact angles.</p>
</div>
<p>This allows
to relate the tension of all the lipid layers and the angle
between them at each instance of the contraction. We can in particular project
the result of this equation onto the direction of the contact surface
tangent (dotted line on <a href="#fig-yd">figure  221</a>):</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-young-tangent">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[\tau_i - W = \tau_1.cos(\theta_1) + \tau_2.cos(\theta_2)\]</div>
<p>And on the direction perpendicular to it :</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-young-perpendicular">
<span class="eqno">(3)</span>\[ \tau_1.sin(\theta_1) = \tau_2.sin(\theta_2)\]</div>
<p>These equations link the tension to the contact angle before, during and
after the contraction and hence remain correct during the experiment. In the following, we will mark the values
before the contraction phase by
the suffix <cite>0</cite>. Thus, for example <span class="math">\(\tau_{i,0}\)</span> refers to the
interface tension before the addition of myosin, and <span class="math">\(\tau_i\)</span> refers to the
interface tension at any instant of the contraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contact-angle-dispersion">
<h3>Contact angle dispersion<a class="headerlink" href="#contact-angle-dispersion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The value of the contact angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> varies across the different doublets both before
and after the  addition of myosin II. This reflects the initial variations of tension in
<span class="math">\(\tau_{i,0}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\tau_{1,0}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\tau_{2,0}\)</span> from doublet to doublet. Such variations could be
due to a difference in the liposome tension acquired during the different preparations, but also to a
variation of adhesion energy between doublets, or alternatively to an effect of tension build-up
during the actin shell formation. As the dispersion in the contact angle is
in the same order as the increase in the angle upon addition of myosin, a
statistical analysis of the contact angle before and during contraction is
problematic. Thus, to avoid this effect of dispersion, we followed the evolution of
<span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> each individual doublet over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tension-of-actin-shell">
<h3>Tension of actin-shell<a class="headerlink" href="#tension-of-actin-shell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to investigate the tension increase due to the acto-myosin network
on liposomes, we first characterised the increase, only due to the addition of the actin-shell in
the absence of myosin. By destroying the F-actin via photo-bleaching (<a href="#fig2a">Fig  222</a>) we compared the shape of the
same doublets in presence and absence of the actin-shell. It should be noted that it is established that the
actin filaments are destroyed by bleaching, as this process frees oxygen radicals that denature the actin monomers. Hence, the bleaching process
actually destroys the actin cortex (<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#vandergucht2005" id="id13">[vanderGucht et al. 05]</a>).
This investigation showed that the total contact
angle changes by <span class="math">\(3.4 \pm 2.0 ^{\circ}\)</span> (n=7) after disruption (<a href="#fig2b">Fig  223</a>) of the actin network.
Thus, we concluded that the tension change due of the actin-shell is negligible
compared to the tension change we can observe with myosin.</p>

<p>The three dimensional imaging of the doublets is necessary to get the correct
contact angle. This requirement comes from the fact that in simple 2D epifluorescence
images, the focal plane would have to correspond to the equatorial plane of the doublets for correct analysis. If
this is not the case, the fit will produce a systematic underestimation of the contact angle.
This is especially the case when doublets are of different radii, as typically found in our

<h3>Different contributions for cortical tension<a class="headerlink" href="#different-contributions-for-cortical-tension" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cortical tension is the sum of the membrane tension and the tension due to the
acto myosin cortex. We questioned how the membrane could contribute to the cortical tension
and in our assay, we showed that in some cases, it might account for approximately 50% of the cortical tension.
In suspended fibroblast cells, the membrane tension is estimated to amount to 10% of the
cortical tension <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#tinevez2009" id="id19">[Tinevez et al. 09]</a>. When the actin polymerisation is
stimulated, the cortical tension is multiplied by a factor of 5, also showing a
strong dependence with actin dynamics <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#tinevez2009" id="id20">[Tinevez et al. 09]</a>. Therefore, the
residual tension in cells might be due to actin dynamics, which is absent in our
experiments. How actin contributes to cortical tension is still an open question
that needs to be addressed to the cell geometry.  Whereas it has been proved that actin polymerisation
outside a liposome generated inward pressure,
the way this observation can be translated into tension  in a different geometry is
not yet clear. <cite>In vitro</cite> assays are on their way to mimic actin dynamics in
cells <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#abushah2014" id="id21">[AbuShah et al. 14]</a>. They will allow to unveil the mechanisms of tension build-up by

<h3>First step: Fitting a single liposome<a class="headerlink" href="#first-step-fitting-a-single-liposome" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this part, we will describe the principle that allowed us to determine the 8
geometrical parameters that characterise a doublet: 2 centers (X,Y,Z) and 2 radii
(<span class="math">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>As the principle for finding the geometrical parameters does not differ with the
number of dimensions, the presented methods can be applied even in higher dimensions (e.g. deformed
ellipsoid liposome, or multi channel imaging). Furthermore, as the principles also remain  similar in a
space with less dimensions, we will restrict our discussion to a single liposome
in a 2D plane (X,Y position of centers and R, radius, hence reducing the parameters to be determined to six instead of eight).</p>
<p>Experimentally, liposomes are observed using fluorescently labeled actin that
forms an homogeneous micrometer-sized actin shell. In the observation plane,
the liposome is a bright ring of a predetermined thickness (we will refer to this as the
<cite>expected signal</cite>). We can observe the experimental noise on top of the image, where the
principal sources are identified as the presence of fluorescent actin monomers in the
buffer solution and electronic noise from the CCD camera.
Eventually, the noise in the outside buffer, due to monomeric actin, can be higher than in the inside buffer, which is actin-free.</p>
<p>The signal from a liposome and the addition of noise can be replicated
numerically as per <a href="#fig-2d-sim">figure  230</a>.</p>

in the acquired images, we can assume a uniform noise on top of the <cite>expected signal</cite>. The correlation between the model and the noise is on average
uniform.

<p>We can test the ability to do this numerically by generating data, adding noise

<div class="section" id="fitting-a-doublet">
<h3>Fitting a doublet<a class="headerlink" href="#fitting-a-doublet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The determination of the contact angle on epifluorescence images or phase contrast
images often results in an underestimation, as the imaging plane is not necessarily one of the doublets
equatorial planes. Moreover, most determinations of the contact angle on phase
contrast and epifluorescence images are handmade <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#maitre2012" id="id22">[Maitre et al. 12]</a> and
are subject to experimenter’s bias, as the experimenter draws the tangent lines at the
contact point between the liposomes. Thus, we decided to develop fitting routines for the acquired
3D confocal stacks. In our case, we avoided the usage of
fluorescent lipids that could artificially change the membrane tension.</p>
<p>As sketched in <a href="#fds">figure  216</a>, the doublets are covered with a
thin micrometer-thick layer of fluorescent actin filaments, which we
imaged by confocal spinning disk microscopy. As the actin-layer is attached to the membrane
and the contact angle is defined as the angle between the lipid bilayer, imaging the actin-layer corresponded
to the angle between the inner surfaces of the two actin networks present on each liposome.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to determine the geometrical parameters of the doublets we also needed
to model the actin shell. As the liposomes in contact consist of two spherical
caps, the uniform actin layer will also form two spherical caps with a given
thickness. The total image is thus the union of two spherical caps blurred by
the point spread function of the microscope. This can be seen on <a href="#mproj1">figure  233</a>.  We can notice on this image the presence of the doublet, lying on the
chamber surface. We checked in this case that the contact surface between the
chamber and the doublet did not change during experiments.</p>
<div class="figure" id="mproj1">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/max_proj_340A.png"><img alt="../_images/max_proj_340A.png" src="../_images/max_proj_340A.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>

One can observe that the liposome doublets are lying on the surface of the
observation chamber (arrows).</p>
</div>
<p>As the doublets contraction is rapid, and the recorded 3D stacks contain a
large number of frames, it is hence crucial to be able to compute the model and the
correlation in a reasonable time (less than an hour per images). To
achieve this besides calculating the model as efficiently as possible, one can
replace the exact calculation of two spherical caps and the point spread
function of the microscope by the union and subtraction of pre-calculated spheres followed by a 3D
numerical Gaussian blur (<a href="#fig-mdl">Fig  234</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-mdl">

followed by a 3D numerical Gaussian blur. Compared to the exact calculation of the fluorescent density, the numerical speed-up allows
to make fits on doublets in minutes instead of hours.</p>
</div>
<p>However, the use of such numerical techniques is not devoid of artefacts.  In the particular case of
discreet Z-stacks that are not sufficiently spaced, the different radii in the
fluorescent rings within subsequent stacks can lead to a &#8220;ring-artefact&#8221; (<a href="#ring-artifact">Fig  235</a>), when using numerical Gaussian blur. In the case of a too
pronounced &#8220;ring-artifact&#8221;, a &#8220;ghost&#8221; spheres can appear around each liposome,
liable to cause the doublets fitting process to fall into a local
maximum of correlation, thus leading to a wrong value of the geometrical
parameters.</p>

numerical Gaussian blur and undersampling afterwards to reach the correct number of

Gaussian blur, which will act as a regularisation

<p>Using the fast Cython code (<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#seljebotn2009" id="id23">[Seljebotn 09]</a>) also allowed to speed
up fitting to a reasonable time: one Z-stack of 3 millions pixels can be fitted
in about 40 seconds, thus allowing the fitting of a full 3D movie of a doublets
contraction to be completed in less than an hour for 30 to 40 frames.</p>
<p>To ensure fits robustness to doublet center displacement during
acquisition, the initial parameter of the fit were chosen manually for each
first frame of each sequence. The final fit parameters of each frame are reused
as initial fit parameters for the subsequent frame.</p>
<p>In order to test the robustness of the fit, we randomly modified the initial fit parameters by +/- 1µm, and we checked that the final parameters did
not vary.</p>
<p>For a couple of parameters, the correlation function values can be plotted
to check the regularity of the function and the absence of local maxima. <a href="#gof2d">Figure  238</a> and <a href="#gof3d">figure  239</a> show the resulting correlation values.</p>

<p>The fit correctness is also checked visually to prevent errors in the
procedure.  We found that the fit was systematically accurate and coherent with the manual
measurements of the contact angle.  Whenever the red channel was also present and the liposomes
contained sulphorhodamin B, we were additionally able to visually check the fits, by using the maximum
projection of the red channel.  (see <a href="#srhod">Fig  240</a>).</p>

<h3>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#id24" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This part aimed at demonstrating that by modelling the liposome doublet and using
fluorescently labeled actin, we were able to develop a technique that
automatically and robustly determined the geometrical properties of the liposome
doublets.</p>
<p>We noted that the red fluorescent dye present in the inside buffer of the
liposome could be used conjointly for the green channel, in order to improve the
fit quality, though this would require the extra parameters of the
interface radius. As the required computation time to fit the doublets increases
rapidly with the parameters number,
we came to the conclusion that this solution was impractical.  Moreover, the interface curvature is relatively small
and the difference between the curved interface and a flat plane close to
the optical resolution, hence the risk for the fits to become unstable.  The use of
fluorescently labeled lipids for the liposome membrane also suffers from the
same issues of extra parameters, if one wants to recover the interface position.</p>

<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#id25" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We developed a robust and automated method to determine the geometrical
parameters of liposome doublets. This allowed to robustly determine the
liposome doublets geometrical parameters without
any experimenter’s measurements bias, thanks to the selection of the illumination plane,
the resolution of optics and the luminosity scale.</p>
<p>We determined that liposome doublets with reconstituted acto-myosin cortices were
a biomimetic system allowing to measure the changes in cortical tension with
time. 3D fitting helped to quantify the tension by obtaining the corresponding contact angles.</p>
<p>A simultaneous observation of the contraction of multiple liposomes doublets and the
ability to automatically determine the geometrical parameters allowed the collection of more
samples. A faster and more reliable data acquisition on actin
network contractions will lead to a better understanding of the effect of actin
network <cite>in vitro</cite> thus also paving the way for the reconstitution of more complex systems.</p>
